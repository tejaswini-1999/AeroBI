My ticket was messed up, I had to take a later flight and sit in the airport for 3 hours, replacement flight was in main cabin when I paid for 1st class, and the plane was SO DISGUSTING. The carpet was so dirty and sticky, it it pulled my shoe off. I cant believe this airline operates this way.   \n",
      "1    Booked a round trip with this company for a family ER. First flight crew was great. Returning Flight I had an altercation with their senior flight attendant who had a disgusting behavior and escalated a situation that could've easily been handled by proper customer service and communication. I approached her and another flight attendant to use the restrooms when it was last call for restrooms use. I was coldly told by both to use the back restrooms where there was a huge line. I explained that I was in a hurry to use it since I've been holding my son who's been asleep the majority of the flight. She said someone was in there. I was aware and asked if I could use it afterwards, the flight attendant seated next to her said \"Yes\" then the senior flight attendant said to me: Maybe if you ask with less attitude you can go in there. Surprised by her response I tell her I did not give her attitude and that she did not need to speak that way and it is true because I did not yell or curse anyone out and even I supposedly gave you attitude, Aren't you trained to handle this in a proper way maybe by communicating with the customer? No, she stood up aggressively, got in my face and started telling me out loud in front of customers that she will not tolerate me to speak with her that way, that I won't be using the restrooms and to take a seat. Sounds pretty personal at this point! Her reaction was unnecessary and all she did is escalate a little restroom situation to where I started yelling at her and pointing out her disgusting behavior. At this point she kept asking me to take a seat and I couldn't because who will take a seat after being spoken to the way she did? Someone without dignity for sure. At this point there's a lot of back and forth going on between us and she then tells me that I will be considered a threat and she will call authorities if I don't take a seat. She was a threat to me by the way she stood up and got in my face and no one in their right mind will tolerate that. At some point I take a seat after my partner comes to calm the situation, I asked her to call authorities. We finally land, authorities are there, my family and I are the first to get out of the plane. The lady that works for authorities asked for my version which I gave and she said that the FA told them that she asked me to take a seat and wait right after I asked to use the restrooms which is false. If you have the audacity to escalate a situation and be disrespectful at least have the audacity to be truthful too.   \n",

Inconvenient food ordering system that has to be done in advance. People who had flight delays/changes with kids and planned to get food in the airport were at risk of having no food available because of the limited amount they had for those who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t order in advance. My flights were either extremely hot or extremely cold. The first class seating had broken charging ports that had coffee spills on them. Stewardess simply said 3 of the first class chargers are broken (out of 8?), so the two of us in my row are out of luck. The tray between the two first class seats was just gross. Dirty. The ticket counter was absolute chaos both on the way here and on the way back. Half of the self serve baggage tag printers were out of paper resulting in long lines, and lots of anxious customers. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it. I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t normally add a review if I thought my experience was an isolated one but there seems to be a lot of shortfalls all over the place with this airline.   \n",

First of all, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still on the plane, it is extremely hot on here, and has been since we all loaded. There are no TVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the back of the seats like most up to date airlines have. The isles are so small you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t walk to the bathroom because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost always someone else in the isle already. I paid extra to sit behind first class in the premium seats but the perks that I paid extra for are non existent. I hit the assistance button to have a drink brought to me, but the stewardess told me to walk to the back of the plane if I want a drink. Also, the stewardess is extremely rude, she clearly hates her job and is not welcoming. I asked for milk for my daughter and she said they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have milk. How do you carry sodas and juice and all the alcohol but not milk?! WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to try and switch our flight with another airline for the flight home because Alaska is so ancient and has been such a let down. Do not recommend. Oh and my seat doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recline. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in premium seating, it should recline. My husbands chair reclines but mine is broken I guess. Also, we struggled but managed to put our daughters car seat in the airline seat and we got her buckled up and then at take off they decided to tell us she needed to be in the window seat with a car seat -why wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you tell us that during boarding?   \n",

We were 2 minutes late to our American flight and they still wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let us in either. Cabin crew was great but pilot screwed us and American Airlines screwed us too.   \n",

My ticket was messed up, I had to take a later flight and sit in the airport for 3 hours, replacement flight was in main cabin when I paid for 1st class, and the plane was SO DISGUSTING. The carpet was so dirty and sticky, it it pulled my shoe off. I cant believe this airline operates this way.   \n",
      "1    Booked a round trip with this company for a family ER. First flight crew was great. Returning Flight I had an altercation with their senior flight attendant who had a disgusting behavior and escalated a situation that could've easily been handled by proper customer service and communication. I approached her and another flight attendant to use the restrooms when it was last call for restrooms use. I was coldly told by both to use the back restrooms where there was a huge line. I explained that I was in a hurry to use it since I've been holding my son who's been asleep the majority of the flight. She said someone was in there. I was aware and asked if I could use it afterwards, the flight attendant seated next to her said \"Yes\" then the senior flight attendant said to me: Maybe if you ask with less attitude you can go in there. Surprised by her response I tell her I did not give her attitude and that she did not need to speak that way and it is true because I did not yell or curse anyone out and even I supposedly gave you attitude, Aren't you trained to handle this in a proper way maybe by communicating with the customer? No, she stood up aggressively, got in my face and started telling me out loud in front of customers that she will not tolerate me to speak with her that way, that I won't be using the restrooms and to take a seat. Sounds pretty personal at this point! Her reaction was unnecessary and all she did is escalate a little restroom situation to where I started yelling at her and pointing out her disgusting behavior. At this point she kept asking me to take a seat and I couldn't because who will take a seat after being spoken to the way she did? Someone without dignity for sure. At this point there's a lot of back and forth going on between us and she then tells me that I will be considered a threat and she will call authorities if I don't take a seat. She was a threat to me by the way she stood up and got in my face and no one in their right mind will tolerate that. At some point I take a seat after my partner comes to calm the situation, I asked her to call authorities. We finally land, authorities are there, my family and I are the first to get out of the plane. The lady that works for authorities asked for my version which I gave and she said that the FA told them that she asked me to take a seat and wait right after I asked to use the restrooms which is false. If you have the audacity to escalate a situation and be disrespectful at least have the audacity to be truthful too.   \n",

Inconvenient food ordering system that has to be done in advance. People who had flight delays/changes with kids and planned to get food in the airport were at risk of having no food available because of the limited amount they had for those who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t order in advance. My flights were either extremely hot or extremely cold. The first class seating had broken charging ports that had coffee spills on them. Stewardess simply said 3 of the first class chargers are broken (out of 8?), so the two of us in my row are out of luck. The tray between the two first class seats was just gross. Dirty. The ticket counter was absolute chaos both on the way here and on the way back. Half of the self serve baggage tag printers were out of paper resulting in long lines, and lots of anxious customers. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it. I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t normally add a review if I thought my experience was an isolated one but there seems to be a lot of shortfalls all over the place with this airline.   \n",

First of all, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still on the plane, it is extremely hot on here, and has been since we all loaded. There are no TVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the back of the seats like most up to date airlines have. The isles are so small you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t walk to the bathroom because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost always someone else in the isle already. I paid extra to sit behind first class in the premium seats but the perks that I paid extra for are non existent. I hit the assistance button to have a drink brought to me, but the stewardess told me to walk to the back of the plane if I want a drink. Also, the stewardess is extremely rude, she clearly hates her job and is not welcoming. I asked for milk for my daughter and she said they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have milk. How do you carry sodas and juice and all the alcohol but not milk?! WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to try and switch our flight with another airline for the flight home because Alaska is so ancient and has been such a let down. Do not recommend. Oh and my seat doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recline. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in premium seating, it should recline. My husbands chair reclines but mine is broken I guess. Also, we struggled but managed to put our daughters car seat in the airline seat and we got her buckled up and then at take off they decided to tell us she needed to be in the window seat with a car seat -why wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you tell us that during boarding?   \n",

We were 2 minutes late to our American flight and they still wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let us in either. Cabin crew was great but pilot screwed us and American Airlines screwed us too.   \n",

My wife's and my names were added to the unaccompanied minor packet, however, the desk agent only added my wife's name into the system, preventing me from being able to get a security pass to meet them at the gate. The ticket agents at DFW airport told us of the error, but made no effort to attempt to find a way to rectify the situation or even show a basic level of human empathy. They said it was the fault of the SeaTac branch and was not their problem. They refused to take any company blame and instead continually tried to push off responsibility and without making any effort to solve a problem. I understand the original problem was created by the SeaTac ticket agent, and they need better training and attention to derail, but the lack of even average customer service at DFW ticket counter really irks me as with just minimal effort on their part, I would at least not be writing poor reviews about Alaskan Airlines. I did file a complaint directly with their company, but after seeing the way they Alaskan's employees represent this airline, I will be looking at taking my business to their competitors in the future. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fly with Alaskan Airlines, their airport employees do not care about their customers.   \n",

Our flight was scheduled to depart at 3:55 PM and was to land at SFO by 6:08 PM. First red flag: Alaska Airlines changed the gate to a completely different part of Seattle's airport last minute. Extremely inconvenient as this was done very close to the alleged boarding time, and Seattle's airport is massive and required several train transfers to reach the new gate. Second red flag: delays without any information. First the flight was delayed from 3:55 PM to 5:02 PM, but no information as to why. Then, the flight was delayed to 6 PM, again no information as to why. Then, 7:40.... 8:10....9:00....9:40....10:00....we finally departed at 10:19 PM (a 6 hour delay) as our airplane was broken and a crew was repairing it for hours. It took over 3 departure time changes for anyone to tell us what was going on, and the Alaskan Airlines representatives were basically unsure as to if we would even be leaving that day as it was \"all up in the air\". Why was there no back up airplane? Why not take an airplane that was scheduled to depart much later in the day/night, and have that flight then use our airplane that was being repaired? Alaska Airlines thought they could mend things by giving us each $100 flight credit to be used for a future flight (which will go to waste as I will never fly with Alaska Airlines again) as well as $24 meal vouchers per person, which if anyone knows the price of airport food then that's enough for maybe 1 sandwich and a drink. Worst flight experience of my life, never again will I fly with Alaska Airlines or recommend Alaska Airlines to friends/family.   \n",

I could not get into the States from Canada to get my flight because I didn't have the ESTA, my kids and husband didn't need one because they are Canadian. We decided they should go ahead and I would wait and fly as soon as I received it. I called Alaska Airlines and they were amazing, no wait to talk to someone, and allowed me to change my flight as needed and only pay the difference. They did not have to do anything to help me really, as my ticket was one of the cheaper options. Once I got the document I needed three days later they got me on the next flight available. Every member of staff I talked with was so polite and professional. The flights went on time and arrived early. I have flown quite a lot in the past and have never been as impressed as I was with Alaska Airlines and I will go out of my way to fly with them again, even though there are usually other options that work better for me flying from Canada. I really don't understand why their rating is not higher.   \n",

No agent at ticket counter in Atlanta and phone agents said they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help. Very rude gate agents. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like this airline does not like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s customers. Use another airline.   \n",

I was on a 5 hour flight and they don't provide you with a meal. They barely give you a snack. I couldn't get any streaming or even texting capabilities unless I wanted to purchase it for $8.00. Or if I was a member of team mobile! On each flight, they are lacking in overhead luggage space so they ask anyone wanting to check a bag will get the ability to get on the plane in group C. So much of an advantage. They don't seem to take the time to clean the aircraft in-between flights. They barely give you the included beverage. They have no in-flight movies unless you have your own mobile device which I couldn't use for their 700 free movies because I couldn't get into it without paying for streaming, but I was able to get into their commercial. They don't have enough space overhead, but if you don't bring on your own device, you are sitting there with nothing to do for 5 hours because you can't get it on your phone. In fact being on the plane is like one big commercial. They ask you if you want to open up their credit card and all the wonderful things you will get after you accrue 30,000 miles. Then the final thing, your luggage will be there in 20 minutes or we will give you some air miles. I will not be flying Alaska Airlines and they can keep your air miles and their nickel and dimming and in my opinion elitest practices.    \n",
