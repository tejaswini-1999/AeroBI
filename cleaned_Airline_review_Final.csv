3801,Alaska Airlines,1,"""carpet was so dirty""",24th July 2023,False," Never again! My ticket was messed up, I had to take a later flight and sit in the airport for 3 hours, replacement flight was in main cabin when I paid for 1st class, and the plane was SO DISGUSTING. The carpet was so dirty and sticky, it it pulled my shoe off.

3802,Alaska Airlines,1,"""have the audacity to be truthful""",23rd July 2023,True,"  Booked a round trip with this company for a family ER. First flight crew was great. Returning Flight I had an altercation with their senior flight attendant who had a disgusting behavior and escalated a situation that could've easily been handled by proper customer service and communication. I approached her and another flight attendant to use the restrooms when it was last call for restrooms use. I was coldly told by both to use the back restrooms where there was a huge line. I explained that I was in a hurry to use it since I've been holding my son who's been asleep the majority of the flight. She said someone was in there. I was aware and asked if I could use it afterwards, the flight attendant seated next to her said ""Yes"" then the senior flight attendant said to me: Maybe if you ask with less attitude you can go in there. Surprised by her response I tell her I did not give her attitude and that she did not need to speak that way and it is true because I did not yell or curse anyone out and even I supposedly gave you attitude, Aren't you trained to handle this in a proper way maybe by communicating with the customer? No, she stood up aggressively, got in my face and started telling me out loud in front of customers that she will not tolerate me to speak with her that way, that I won't be using the restrooms and to take a seat. Sounds pretty personal at this point! Her reaction was unnecessary and all she did is escalate a little restroom situation to where I started yelling at her and pointing out her disgusting behavior. At this point she kept asking me to take a seat and I couldn't because who will take a seat after being spoken to the way she did? Someone without dignity for sure. At this point there's a lot of back and forth going on between us and she then tells me that I will be considered a threat and she will call authorities if I don't take a seat. She was a threat to me by the way she stood up and got in my face and no one in their right mind will tolerate that. At some point I take a seat after my partner comes to calm the situation, I asked her to call authorities. We finally land, authorities are there, my family and I are the first to get out of the plane. The lady that works for authorities asked for my version which I gave and she said that the FA told them that she asked me to take a seat and wait right after I asked to use the restrooms which is false. If you have the audacity to escalate a situation and be disrespectful at least have the audacity to be truthful too.",,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Orlando,2023-07-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no,AS
3803,Alaska Airlines,2,"""a lot of shortfalls all over the place""",22nd July 2023,True,"  No in flight entertainment. Inconvenient food ordering system that has to be done in advance. People who had flight delays/changes with kids and planned to get food in the airport were at risk of having no food available because of the limited amount they had for those who didnâ€™t order in advance. My flights were either extremely hot or extremely cold. The first class seating had broken charging ports that had coffee spills on them. Stewardess simply said 3 of the first class chargers are broken (out of 8?), so the two of us in my row are out of luck. The tray between the two first class seats was just gross. Dirty. The ticket counter was absolute chaos both on the way here and on the way back. Half of the self serve baggage tag printers were out of paper resulting in long lines, and lots of anxious customers. I donâ€™t get it. I wouldnâ€™t normally add a review if I thought my experience was an isolated one but there seems to be a lot of shortfalls all over the place with this airline.",Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,First Class,Anchorage to Detroit via Seattle,2023-07-01,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,AS
3804,Alaska Airlines,1,"""Absolutely terrible experience""",22nd July 2023,True,"  Absolutely terrible experience flying with Alaska. First of all, Iâ€™m still on the plane, it is extremely hot on here, and has been since we all loaded. There are no TVâ€™s on the back of the seats like most up to date airlines have. The isles are so small you canâ€™t walk to the bathroom because thereâ€™s almost always someone else in the isle already. I paid extra to sit behind first class in the premium seats but the perks that I paid extra for are non existent. I hit the assistance button to have a drink brought to me, but the stewardess told me to walk to the back of the plane if I want a drink. Also, the stewardess is extremely rude, she clearly hates her job and is not welcoming. I asked for milk for my daughter and she said they donâ€™t have milk. How do you carry sodas and juice and all the alcohol but not milk?! Weâ€™re going to try and switch our flight with another airline for the flight home because Alaska is so ancient and has been such a let down. Do not recommend. Oh and my seat doesnâ€™t recline. Iâ€™m in premium seating, it should recline. My husbands chair reclines but mine is broken I guess. Also, we struggled but managed to put our daughters car seat in the airline seat and we got her buckled up and then at take off they decided to tell us she needed to be in the window seat with a car seat -why wouldnâ€™t you tell us that during boarding?",,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Austin to Seattle,2023-07-01,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no,AS

We were 2 minutes late to our American flight and they still wouldnâ€™t let us in either.

3806,Alaska Airlines,1,"""employees do not care about customers""",18th July 2023,False,"  After 3 weeks of visiting my family in Washington, two of my children were returning to Texas today unaccompanied. My wife's and my names were added to the unaccompanied minor packet, however, the desk agent only added my wife's name into the system, preventing me from being able to get a security pass to meet them at the gate. The ticket agents at DFW airport told us of the error, but made no effort to attempt to find a way to rectify the situation or even show a basic level of human empathy. They said it was the fault of the SeaTac branch and was not their problem. They refused to take any company blame and instead continually tried to push off responsibility and without making any effort to solve a problem. I understand the original problem was created by the SeaTac ticket agent, and they need better training and attention to derail, but the lack of even average customer service at DFW ticket counter really irks me as with just minimal effort on their part, I would at least not be writing poor reviews about Alaskan Airlines. I did file a complaint directly with their company, but after seeing the way they Alaskan's employees represent this airline, I will be looking at taking my business to their competitors in the future.

3807,Alaska Airlines,1,"""Worst flight experience of my life""",17th July 2023,True," My partner and I were traveling from Seattle back home to San Francisco on 7/16/2023, and I purposefully purchased an earlier flight from Seattle as we were traveling on a Sunday and both of us had work the following morning. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 3:55 PM and was to land at SFO by 6:08 PM. First red flag: Alaska Airlines changed the gate to a completely different part of Seattle's airport last minute. Extremely inconvenient as this was done very close to the alleged boarding time, and Seattle's airport is massive and required several train transfers to reach the new gate. Second red flag: delays without any information. First the flight was delayed from 3:55 PM to 5:02 PM, but no information as to why. Then, the flight was delayed to 6 PM, again no information as to why. Then, 7:40.... 8:10....9:00....9:40....10:00....we finally departed at 10:19 PM (a 6 hour delay) as our airplane was broken and a crew was repairing it for hours. It took over 3 departure time changes for anyone to tell us what was going on, and the Alaskan Airlines representatives were basically unsure as to if we would even be leaving that day as it was ""all up in the air"". Why was there no back up airplane? Why not take an airplane that was scheduled to depart much later in the day/night, and have that flight then use our airplane that was being repaired? Alaska Airlines thought they could mend things by giving us each $100 flight credit to be used for a future flight (which will go to waste as I will never fly with Alaska Airlines again) as well as $24 meal vouchers per person, which if anyone knows the price of airport food then that's enough for maybe 1 sandwich and a drink.

3808,Alaska Airlines,9,"""cannot say enough good things""",16th July 2023,False," This was my first time flying with Alaska Airlines and I cannot say enough good things. I could not get into the States from Canada to get my flight because I didn't have the ESTA, my kids and husband didn't need one because they are Canadian. We decided they should go ahead and I would wait and fly as soon as I received it. I called Alaska Airlines and they were amazing, no wait to talk to someone, and allowed me to change my flight as needed and only pay the difference. They did not have to do anything to help me really, as my ticket was one of the cheaper options. Once I got the document I needed three days later they got me on the next flight available. Every member of staff I talked with was so polite and professional. The flights went on time and arrived early. I have flown quite a lot in the past and have never been as impressed as I was with Alaska Airlines and I will go out of my way to fly with them again, even though there are usually other options that work better for me flying from Canada.

3810,Alaska Airlines,1,"""one of the worst airlines""",13th July 2023,False,"  Alaska Airlines in my opinion is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown. I was on a 5 hour flight and they don't provide you with a meal. They barely give you a snack. I couldn't get any streaming or even texting capabilities unless I wanted to purchase it for $8.00. Or if I was a member of team mobile! On each flight, they are lacking in overhead luggage space so they ask anyone wanting to check a bag will get the ability to get on the plane in group C. So much of an advantage. They don't seem to take the time to clean the aircraft in-between flights. They barely give you the included beverage. They have no in-flight movies unless you have your own mobile device which I couldn't use for their 700 free movies because I couldn't get into it without paying for streaming, but I was able to get into their commercial. They don't have enough space overhead, but if you don't bring on your own device, you are sitting there with nothing to do for 5 hours because you can't get it on your phone. In fact being on the plane is like one big commercial. They ask you if you want to open up their credit card and all the wonderful things you will get after you accrue 30,000 miles. Then the final thing, your luggage will be there in 20 minutes or we will give you some air miles. I will not be flying Alaska Airlines and they can keep your air miles and their nickel and dimming and in my opinion elitest practices.

At the end of the long process, Alaska Airlines informed me that my seats were no longer available. They made me start completely over, could not just start me in the seating chart. When I got to seats, my seats were still available. But my fare was about a 3rd more expensive. This is flat dishonest. I used to fly even more often. Alaska used to be the best airline.

3816,Alaska Airlines,1,"""I do not recommend this airline""",27th June 2023,True,"  This is my second review. When I was finally able to reach an Alaska Airlines representative by phone and explain the situation, I learned that there was no unaccompanied minor status applied to our child when the reservation was made by phone, contrary to what my husband was told by the airline representative at the time of purchase. I was informed when I was making my complaint that unaccompanied minor status was only paid for and applied at time of check in. Why didnâ€™t the phone representative inform my husband when he placed the reservation? I also learned Alaska Airlines is focused on money more than a minorâ€™s safety. I explained that I had been allowed to accompany my child to the gate for the departing flight and the supervisor I was speaking to exclaimed, â€œAnd she didnâ€™t charge you!â€ I would not have expected to be charged just as I did not expect to fill out a form during check-in because we believed we had paid it as part of the rather expensive ticket we already paid. The supervisor criticized me for not searching out this information on the website. We believed everything was taken care of because we had Spoken to Alaska airline representatives, both when we made the reservation and during check-in. Apparently representativeâ€™s words cannot be trusted. Because of the lack of competency on the part of Alaska airlines, our minor child was not met by the guardian at the gate upon arrival. The guardian was not allowed to accompany our minor child through security on the return flight, and was not present as guardian and witness when our minor child was searched all around their privates by TSA. Because of Alaska airlines incompetency, I was not allowed to meet my own child at the gate. If I had not directly asked the representative what was required when I was denied a gate pass, I never we would have even heard about the â€œyellow form â€œ.

I realized I was not booked correctly. I reached out to Air to Sea and they said no problem, just download the apps and change seats. On my flight there I was booked on American Airlines. I went on the app, easily upgraded to first class, the staff was super helpful, and they even upgraded my entire family for free! The flight was comfy, the staff on the plane were great, and I had zero panic attacks. Not the same experience with Alaska Airlines. They would not help me. They told me we had plenty up upgrades available and it was a small fee to upgrade. Then the staff said never mind we can't help you because you went through Air to Sea. So we called Air to Sea that said they can't help because the airline does not allow them to see first class. After going back and forth we got both sides on the phone at the same time where Alaska Airlines said they would upgrade us for over $1,000 a ticket! Wow. Horrible customer service, very petty because we booked through Air to Sea, treated us terrible like we had done something wrong, not to mention plenty of seating they are refusing to sell us.

When I pointed this out to their representative Val at Seattle Airport he told me I wasn't entitled to any compensation. After an overnight flight I was too tired to push my case and accepted what he said. But when I arrived at my hotel and emptied the bag to check the mechanism I discovered the mechanism at the bottom of the suitcase bent which has now jammed the handle making it useless. This is obviously from damage from poor handling. Their web site freezes regularly and there is no way to even send them a message to claim compensation or take this matter further. Having flown Hawaiian Airlines to many islands in Hawaii and enjoying the warm and genuine friendly and cheerful staff on Hawaiian it was a stark contrast traveling with Alaska Airlines for the first time. Whereas the flight attendants on Hawaiian greet every passenger when boarding my wife and I noticed that he Flight Attendants on Alsaka were too busy talking to each other when we boarded to even greet us!

They booked our flights to Kona the next day, booked a night at the Comfort Inn and gave us food vouchers with no cost to us.

3829,Alaska Airlines,1,"""airline is one of the worst""",25th April 2023,True,"  Aircraft was in poor condition. I paid for a premium seat upgrade, and the seat was super narrow and not worth the extra cost. There was no under seat storage for two of the three seats in my row. The overhead bins are miniscule and they ran out of space before half the plane was boarded. The flight attendants were fairly inattentive to their movements and rammed into me multiple times, despite being fully out of the aisle. When beverage service started i spent a solid 5 minutes with the second seat flight attendant's bum repeatedly being shoved in my face. I understand they have a job to do, but the lack of respect for passengers space is abysmal. The airlines need to consider this when designating aisle space. The curtain separating first class is not tied/otherwise secured, and i spent 90% of the flight with it flapping in my face (seat C6). This airline is one of the worst I've had the misfortune to fly with. Every trip has been subpar, but to charge for premium seating and  cram people in like sardines in this row is outrageous. Delta or southwest are far preferable because even when they're awful, they're better than Alaska on a good day. Flights are also super limited with awful flight times for non stops, and ridiculous layovers for multi-stop trips. On board wifi is trash and not worth the $8 they Want out of you.

I am not the smallest girl nor am I the largest but I will say I do fit in my seat well but the other two passengers next to me are a little bigger so it doesnâ€™t allow me to sit in my seat all the way and I am pushed to the edge of my seat closest to the isle (my arm is kind of over the armrest where if someone is larger sized walking by they will bump into me). However the flight attendants on this flight seem to be fit and are not overweight at all, which is mind boggling to me because neither one of them walking by that pushed bumped or ran into my arm with the cart are overweight or obese so in my mind thereâ€™s no reason why they should be bumping me in the aggressive way they have been this whole flight so far. Neither of them apologized or even acknowledged me when they did bump into me I find it very unprofessional and unpleasant and I donâ€™t plan on flying with Alaska again after this experience. Even someone on the plane twice the size of Gail turned to where she wasnâ€™t bumping into me.

Cons 1) The twin-engine plane (Boeing 737, I believe) economy seating is just enough to be problematic for anyone who has claustrophobia. Additionally, the fold-out for laptops is only big enough for the PC; you want to use a mouse, well, need to use another fold-out on your right. 2) If want additional elbow room, first-class ticket is necessary 3) Lavatories are small enough that anyone significantly fat will feel cramped.

3846,Alaska Airlines,1,"""so uncomfortable and sad""",6th January 2023,True," Let me start this rant by saying I fly a lot, usually with Delta, but occasionally with AA if they have a quicker route, then transfer to Alaska airline for the last leg of my trip into Nome (Delta doesnâ€™t fly there). Iâ€™ve NEVER had any complaints about a flight crew - ever. Instead, Iâ€™m the person watching out for the flight crew - completely in awe of the long shifts they work and the kindness they show to each of us. Always grateful for all they do. Like everyone else, often bewildered by the general rudeness of some of the public towards the staff. That was NOT my experience today 1/5/23. Alaska airline flight had a quicker route that sent me through Portland to Anchorage, so I chose it. Because of the amount of miles I fly, I typically get upgraded to first class (even if I donâ€™t purchase). Today, there was no first class seats for purchase, so I ended up sitting in business class, exactly one row behind first class. I was completely fine with that. Again, no complaints. The reason for the rant. I had a horrible experience today. My Alaska airline flight 197 was delayed approx. 1 - 1.5 hours. The flight was originally a late night flight anyway, so this just made things a bit worse, but completely understandable. Things happen. The flight crew canâ€™t control when the plane arrival/departure. However, 3 hours into my delayed flight, while everyone was sound asleep, absolutely no movement at all throughout the plane, complete graveyard silence, I got up to use the restroom and walked to the closest one (literally 5 rows in front of me) in first class. A beautiful blonde flight attendant walked up to me and told me to turn around and go to the restroom in the back. Again, no one was up in the aisles or in line for either restroom. Everyone was asleep. It absolutely floored me - really embarrassed me as the gentleman sitting next to me overheard it and rolled his eyes as I had to turn around. I see people from business class use first class restrooms all the time. Iâ€™ve never been offended. Iâ€™ve never seen anyone rerouted to the back. Anyway, I went to the back restroom and asked the two flight attendants working the back if there was a policy or some rule that I was unaware of. Minutes later - the two attendants in the back - rushed to the front to â€tell on meâ€. Then for a absolutely NO reason, they proceeded to make an announcement over the intercom to everyone - instructing non first class people to use the back restroom - mind you - NO one except me was had been or was up moving around. My concern, do they commonly bully people that are not in first class? Do they make a point to try and embarrass customers? The announcement was petty and team bullying. For the first time, I understand why people speak up and confront flight attendants for treating them poorly. I get it. They have you in a position of submission while your traveling. Itâ€™s so uncomfortable and sad. I suppose the lesson for me - always fly Delta, but more importantly, be mindful of how people who donâ€™t have the means to fly first class are being treated as they may not be the â€œrudeâ€ passengers I once thought that they were to flight staff.",,Business,Business Class,Portland to Nome via Anchorage,2023-01-01,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no,AS

3856,Alaska Airlines,1,"""the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way""",19th December 2022,True," Alaska airlines, we will never fly with you again. All excited to take our daughter who loves flights on her first flight, and the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way. We let the woman at the gate know it was her first flight and asked if they still got wings and an opportunity to see the cockpit, and the response, ""well it's case by case but I'll tell the flight crew"". Board the flight, no one knew it was her first flight, so whatever we make our way to our seats. Daughter (who just turned two) is now crying because she couldn't see, ok no problem we didn't promise anything to her. We had purchased her a seat so she could have some space, but she only wanted to be held when the plane took off. Still crying and stewardess who was either having a bad day, or clearly has no kids, tells us she ""must be strapped into her own seat"". I explained she was crying and would be better for everyone if we could just comfort her, she gives a nasty look and says ""nope, strap her in"". Wonderful, cue hysterical baby, sorry everyone around us. At this point my child is crying hysterically, borderline throwing up, so we pick her up to comfort her (we were at a stand still on the ground, not even moving or ready for take-off), and here comes stewardess number 2. She clearly sees what's going on and we explain we just need a couple moments to settle her, she looks over at stewardess number 1 who shakes her head, and tells us we have no choice but to strap her in. So I apologize to everyone around us, and my wife and I try to console our hyperventilating daughter who continues to cry inconsolably, till we reach altitude and we are able to rip her out of the seat and settle her. First wave of drinks come out and we are completely disgusted with these woman, and stewardess number one walks over and tosses a set of wings at my wife full of attitude and says ""somebody's first flight eh"". Laughs like she had enjoyed this whole thing. Total train wreck, daughter throws up all over both of us because she was so upset, and no one cared. Another family in the row across from us with a baby was completely disgusted, these two women were acting the way they were. Oh and just to round out the 5+ hour flight from hell, the extremely over-priced wifi I paid for to play a movie and settle our daughter, would not work. It took barely 1 hour of restarts, paid time outs, credit card time outs, and buffering to get it to barely play movie. The movie timed out twice for now reason and when it finally came back the third time the speaking didn't match the peoples mouths. Tried to open a couple games and those wouldn't work because of the wifi either. Several people around us had the same struggles and some asked for refunds and were just left staring at the seat in front of them. Of the hundreds of thousands of miles I have flown, I have never been so disappointed and let down. Pilots who cant be bothered to greet kids. Flight attendants acting angry and vindictive, while also apparently enjoying acting that way. No monitors on a 5+ hour flight and garbage over-priced wifi instead.

It took only a couple of minutes. When we got to PreCheck security line there were only a couple of people ahead of us. After going through security we headed to the Alaska Air Lounge. The lounge was not that crowded, large, and spotless. There were plenty choices of food on offer, including an automatic pancake machine. At the gate, we were promptly boarded and greeted by the agent by our first names. The plane was a typical EM175 and the seats were very comfortable.

3859,Alaska Airlines,1,"""rude customer service representative""",5th December 2022,False,"  We had a layover in Seattle on November 29th. Once we got there our second flight was canceled after waiting 2 hours for the delayed flight. The customer service line was extremely long. After about an hour in line I finally reached a customer service agent to help me get my flight changed. By that time there were no available seats on any flights that day, but I had been trying to change my flight while in line and I got a confirmation for a 9pm flight. When I stated that to the rep, she said they had double booked the seat that I was assigned to, but that she will get my on the flight since the other person had not checked in yet. She printed my ticket and handed it to me. After that I asked if there would be any compensation as we were supposed to be home by 12pm and now we had to wait until 9pm for potentially another delayed or canceled flight and this has already been hard on my family. The rep provided no help whatsoever and explained not-so-nicely that because this was not Alaskaâ€™s fault, they are not responsible for providing compensation. This made me wonder, what would be considered â€œtheir faultâ€, or is this some fine print that they can get out of any compensation. By this time it had stopped snowing for a couple hours and everything was melted. I couldnâ€™t understand why all other flight carriers were taking off and landing just fine, yet Alaska had to cancel our flight completely. I understood the delay in the de-icing. I asked why it is our fault that Alaska doesnâ€™t have this figured out. Even on the Alaskaâ€™s website it stated that they had flights prepared for the upcoming weather and that they had it all figured out. The rep started to get frustrated with me and started getting snarky. She stated that â€œif we give you compensation, we had to give everyone in this line compensationâ€. To which I replied â€œyou shouldâ€. She continued to ramble about this weather is causing delays and I told her to look outside and I said â€œwhat weather?â€ Again in hadnâ€™t been snowing and I was irritated that this was the excuse when everything was melted and it wasnâ€™t snowing. She yelled at me and stated â€œGive me back your ticketsâ€. So she was threatening to take my tickets away for the only available flight out for the rest of the day?! I was appalled! I stated â€œnoâ€ you cannot take my tickets. She started getting irate and stated she has been working here for 15 years and that she is working overtime and she shouldnâ€™t even be here, that she should be home. I couldnâ€™t believe she was escalating things as a customer service rep of 15 years, when she should be helping me out. I stated I should be home by now too! I really felt like I was calm throughout the whole conversation and yet she continued to escalate the conversation. At the end of the interaction I stated that â€œYou will be losing a customer, not that you careâ€. And she said extremely snarky â€œNo, I donâ€™t think we willâ€. I said â€œExcuse me, you donâ€™t think you will what?â€ She reiterated, â€œI donâ€™t think we will be losing a customerâ€. What type of rude customer service representative did I just encounter? Is it my problem that she is overworked? I felt attacked and vulnerable as she tried to take away my only way of getting my family home. I asked for her name and she would not provide me her last name. As I was leaving she yelled that she would be â€œnotating my accountâ€, again threatening me as much as she could.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Kalispell,2022-11-01,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,AS

Nowhere on Alaska's website does it say that credits can't be used for seat upgrades. Inquiring with customer service I was told that seat upgrades are ""service charges"" and are therefore excluded. On our recent flight from Austin-Bergstrom to Seattle I upgraded to Premium Economy, paying with a cc, not a credit, but was informed the day before that the livery had changed from a 737-900 to a 737-700 and there were no Premium seats.

I rebooked on my own because Alaska would not cancel the flight. The noon flight ended up leaving at 8:15. In 40 years of flying, this is the worst experience I've ever had with an airline.

Our last two trips, all in 2022, have had our flights changed multiple times including loss of our premium seats and reassigned to horrible seats. Both trips we used our companion ticket. The trip to Costa Rica was booked LAX to SJO non-stop but both on the trip down and back have added a stop in Liberia which Alaska used as an excuse to bump us from our premium seats. Our trip back to the States, we checked in showing stop in Liberia and confirmed premium seats and purchased food only to wake up and find they had changed it again showing no stop to Liberia and loss of premium seats from LAX to PDX (giving us a seat with no windows). No food. We are now boarded and informed we are stopping in Liberia even though our boarding pass shows direct to LAX. I donâ€™t know what is going on but they are no longer reliable in terms of booking a flight or picking a seat. Count yourself lucky if you get on a flight.

3867,Alaska Airlines,3,"""Do not count on Alaska Airlines to help""",11th November 2022,True,"  Do not count on Alaska Airlines to help if you request mobility assistance. In Boston - I requested assistance, they refused to help me to the counter. My luggage was falling, I was tripping. But I got no help! Then I was told I had to put my checked luggage on the platform. I said I needed help I was told ""you have to put your luggage up here"". So a disabled woman tripping and falling over a cane managed to put up a 50 pound piece of luggage. Only after did the incompetent woman ask if I needed assistance? I had asked for help three times and was told no! So I said - if I'm required and able to lift a 50 pound suitcase by myself, I will get myself down to the gate since Alaska Airlines is useless. On my way from Anchorage to Boston I took Delta - I had to pay/tip every person who touched the wheelchair - and I still had to pick up my own baggage? I got to the gate myself bumbling through TSA, who wondered why I didn't have help. When I said I was with Alaska Airlines, they won't help - the woman said ""Ah - yes Alaska Airlines, no, they are not much help"" and she proceeded to help me. I arrived at the gate and was immediately pursued by an irate employee asking me loudly my name - and very loudly stating they have to fill out a form for when a customer requests assistance but refuses the wheelchair. I quietly explained the situation, and he continued to chastise me, mimic my words - told him to rip it up. No problems here. He refused. He got louder and more obnoxious. He demanded an explanation - I said, if you're going to make me lift a 50 pound bag by myself, after I kept asking for help - I figure I'll be better off getting myself to the gate. I regret not filing a report on this guy, but I have sympathy because its very difficult to get competent help in Massachusetts or Logan airport. I arrived in Seattle, jumped in their wheelchair and barely made it to the connection. Arrived in Anchorage - there was a rep on the ramp talking on the radio stating he had already requested wheelchairs that were not there. So I didn't bother to hang around. I walked all over the airport and I am in serious pain, I will never depend on Alaska Airlines to help anyone disabled. It works against us and we have to tip everyone so it costs more.

I asked to have it reversed and she stated, ""there is nothing I can do. We have this a lot. Scammers cancel the tickets and try to get the refund."" I asked why there isn't a verification text or email to confirm the cancelation? Especially if this is something that happens often. She then said we could purchase tickets at a 400% mark up.

They say it will be another 20-40 minutes until we can get off the plane (Iâ€™m annoyed at this point but recognize itâ€™s almost over Iâ€™ll be home soon) 8) This process repeats multiple times.

We even googled their flight number and knew exactly where they were at all times. One if the kids was texting us from 35,000 feet. They had a snack on board and watched movies during their flight.

3888,Alaska Airlines,3,"""a frustrating experience""",20th August 2022,True,"  I had a frustrating experience with Alaska. I got a round trip from San Jose to San Diego with my family and among the free items you can check-in are strollers and car seats. On the first flight we were able to check-in for free our son's car seat and wagon-stroller for free. We even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagon-stroller with us for free. However on the return flight we had to pay to document and check-in the wagon-stroller. The handling of situation was terrible from Alaska. They argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any Alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape. The personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not (even though our could be smaller). We showed them the model on the internet (which states it is a stroller wagon) and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers. They argued that allowing us to check-in our ""wagon"" for free during our first flight was a mistake. To make matters even worse, the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller. This suggested to me that Alaska didn't care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on Alaska's policies, which Alaska was not able to provide. Along this lines (about not really being helpful) and taking their attitude to a different level, one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to ""solve"" the problem threatened us by saying ""do you want to fly today?"". Not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse. In the end a more cool headed personnel came in, acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain. This frustrating and unpleasant experience was a result of the poorly documented, inconsistent policies and communication channels at Alaska, and exacerbated by the even worse customer service from Alaska employees at the San Diego airport. I will avoid using Alaska in the future as it is not worth the stress.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to San Jose,2022-08-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,no,AS

Despite the flight not being full, they told me they could not allow me to board because as soon as they check for empty seats, they have to close the gate.

I had never used Alaska before but after a recommendation from a friend, decided to give them a go. I had just arrived on a 13 hour flight from New Zealand, arriving at LAX and needing an onward flight to SFO. I checked in via a kiosk for the SFO flight and I was lucky enough to be offered a $20 upgrade to First Class which I logically accepted. Everything went seamlessly from check in, right through to priority boarding on the plane which was an Embraer ERJ 175. I was so impressed with the way the First Class team member dealt with a very self obsessed passenger who was demanding a lot of attention in the First Class cabin. At no stage did the team member lose it with this passenger and she remained professional and cordial at all times. I was actually sorry the flight was so short as the service was so good. The flight back on 5th July was on an Airbus A320. Check in was painless but TSA was a nightmare as everyone was flying home after the 4th. We were probably just over an hour late departing. This flight was just as enjoyable, very slick and polished and I have no qualms about using Alaska while flying internally in the US. I should use United my default Star Alliance option, but with this pricing and service I am quite happy to use Alaska in future.",Embraer / A320,Solo Leisure,First Class,Los Angeles to San Francisco,2022-07-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes,AS

3897,Alaska Airlines,1,"""we're never flying Alaska again, I'm sticking with Southwest""",15th July 2022,True," Alaska Airlines lost 4 customers with how they handled their affairs. My partner's 10 year old son and his friend / guardian were supposed to fly out of PDX, after visiting us for two weeks, on July 13th for a 10 am flight. After they boarded, everyone on the flight got the run around as to why they were delayed and then had to get off the flight and got rebooked for the following day, July 14th for 3pm. For some reason they were told to get off the plane but their luggage somehow made it to Seattle, which was an absolute nightmare because my partners son doesn't live with us, nor his friend, so they didn't have anything as to clothes or toiletries for the next day, except whatever they were wearing. My partner's friend and son waited about 6 hours after the supposed initial take off at the airport due to the delays, with three of those hours getting the run around as to where their luggage is. My partner had to leave work to go pick them up. I get on the phone with Alaska that evening after work to try to find out where their bags are and to get compensation for the whole deal. We told Alaska to not send it back to Portland if they weren't able to get it that night, to just send it to Albuquerque, which they reassured us. They gave us a $50 voucher for each to get underwear, socks, and stuff for the night and told us to call customer care in the morning. I called customer care in the morning and the lady was just God awful, no help what so ever. I asked for a refund on the $60 luggage fee since they didn't get have their luggage and thought that was a fair compensation. We were told Alaska doesn't do refunds and put me back on the phone with baggage. Baggage reassured us that the bags would be in Albuquerque when they landed. Well they landed in Albuquerque to find out that their luggage was sent back to Portland and they will fly it back to deliver it later to their address sometime this week or next week. Seriously? First Alaska delayed their flight until the next day, gave us the run around and we lost work hours, can't give us a straight story on the luggage claim, and when we ask just for the a refund on the $60 luggage fee they so no, we don't do refunds but here's a $50 voucher for a future flight. How about no, we are never flying Alaska Airlines again. I flew Southwest last year and my flight was delayed 4 hours, they gave me a $100 voucher without even asking. Seriously Alaska? You messed up hardcore with the flight being reschedule and losing their luggage and all that was compensated was a $50 voucher with the worst customer service? Yeah, we're never flying Alaska again, I'm sticking with Southwest, they've never done me dirty.

During the flight, I needed to use the restroom badly. We were seated approximately 2 to 3 rows from first class. Therefore, the first class restroom was much closer than the main cabin restrooms. I was willing to use the main cabin restroom, and I had used the main cabin restroom previously. This one time, though, there was an excessive line. I have a bladder issue, unfortunately, and waiting in line to use the restroom would have been difficult as I was in pain. So, I went to try to use the first class restroom. When I attempted to use the first class restroom, I was met with resistance by the stewardesses in that the stewardesses would not allow me to use the restroom. The flight attendant stood in front of me and stated â€œ the bathroom is in the back.â€ I explained to both how I have a bladder issue and I am in need to use the bathroom. They both stated I am not in first class and that I need to go use the bathroom in the back. I explained that there is a long time and I was unable to wait due to my pain. She shrugged her shoulders and stated I was not in first class and I cannot use that bathroom. They had no empathy and put arbitrary rules above a passengerâ€™s physical well being.

I asked other passengers what was going on, they said they didnâ€™t know either but someone who works for Allegiant was at the desk just long enough to tell them, â€œI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on. Just sit still.â€ So they did. I checked the Departures board, said on time. 15 minutes later, everyoneâ€™s phones go off. Allegiant sent a TEXT to all passengers about the delay. Not one human interaction! We go get dinner. We are waiting in the USO for our now 8.18pm flight.

4013,Allegiant Air,1,"""So disappointing and astounding""",19th June 2023,False,"  I write reviews a lot online, and 95% of the time, I only write reviews for positive interactions. I feel that negative reviews are generally screwed by emotion, frustration, or anger. And that we have enough negativity in our world. So I try to keep things positive. In this case, I think itâ€™s necessary to document the worst customer service Iâ€™ve ever experienced - which came from Allegiant phone customer service. I have never been treated so poorly by an employee of a company that Iâ€™ve spent hundreds of dollars patronizing (or any company, for that matter). There was a mix-up when my family flew in for a visit. Their return flight was canceled after they missed an outbound flight, and when we realized this (the night before their return flight), I called to understand the situation. Originally, the gate agent told them their return flight would not be canceled but that they could keep it. So we were surprised when we couldnâ€™t find the reservation for them to check-in. The person who I talked to on the phone to try to fix the problem was unbelievably rude. After discussing the situation, she didnâ€™t believe my family because the agent didnâ€™t make notes, and her attitude toward me was unlike any experience Iâ€™ve ever had with a customer service person. I intentionally did my best to stay calm, not raise my voice or have a frustrated or angry tone and asked to speak with her supervisor after she yelled at me. After continuing to be berated by the employee, I calmly continued to ask to talk with her supervisor. She denied me the opportunity several times (she said the supervisor couldnâ€™t help) and eventually *hung up the phone on me!* I understand and can appreciate how hard customer service jobs must be. So again, I did everything possible not to talk down to this person or raise my voice. And I was hung up on. I donâ€™t understand how this airline could possibly prioritize basic respect for one another if this was how their employee acted. I assume they are not teaching patience or customer care (human care) in any fashion. Honestly, nobody should be treated with the disrespect this person showed. The way I was treated was not worth saving a little money to fly cheaply. I could not get this person's name or employee information and am not sure how to follow up on such an extreme situation, so Iâ€™m writing a review online in hopes of steering others away from such a challenging circumstance and genuinely negative interaction with another human being. Our world has enough trouble and challenges these days; there should be no reason to experience interactions like this one, especially in a professional setting.

4018,Allegiant Air,2,"""he decided not to fly at all""",16th May 2023,True,"  Flight was originally scheduled May 12 from FNT to LAS. We received an update flight was being delayed reason given was that there was air traffic controller issue at LAS. FAA site confirmed that a runway had to be closed etc. The problem here is a few mins after the announcement I saw the pilot walk off the plane with all his belongings. But the gate agents continued to update as flight is delayed. Hours later the airline gave an update calling it an extended delay and the flight will not leave until May 13. I thought it was odd that the pilot who left never returned. Because the pilot got tired of waiting he decided not to fly at all. The crew from May 13 advised us of that. So we missed a vacation day, lost money on non-refundable tours, etcâ€¦ all be use Allegiant pilot through a childish temper tantrum for a 3 hour delay. We could have flown and made it to the destination on May 12. Allegiant found a loop hole pertaining to cancellation of flight by calling it an extended delay vs. cancellation. So by doing so they avoid providing refunds for the trip. Not sure about anyone else, but if a scheduled flight does not leave the day itâ€™s supposed to then that is a cancellation in my book. Allegiant ruined a part of my vacation and we only got a voucher that did not even come close at recovering the money we lost because of a single pilot was tired of waiting. Iâ€™m astonished that an airline who operates this way is still even around. . This is a low cost airline, and I know that you get what you pay for but there are limits to that even. On a good note airline had to call in a crew to fly us to LAS on their normal day off.

I was running late for my returning flight (my fault) and I spoke to every employee I could find to help me make my flight. They said youâ€™re going to have to run and maybe youâ€™ll make it. So I was one of those people sprinting through the airport up and down stairs through crowds and I make it to the gate and they said we have a delay. Something they could have told me before I pushed my cardiovascular health to its limits. At this point we have a 2 hour delay because of â€œmechanical issuesâ€ with no end in sight. You always hear the cheap airlines are bad: Allegiant might be the worst of them all. If I could, I would rate them -10/10.

Throughout this process, I found that Allegiant's customer service team kept tossing the ball to each other, with no one taking responsibility or ownership of the issue. Despite my repeated attempts to get a resolution, there was no customer service whatsoever. No one was able to take responsibility and fix my issue. To add insult to injury, the file was closed on their system without issuing the refund I was promised. It was a complete nightmare, and I am extremely disappointed in the way Allegiant handled my case. Overall, I would strongly caution against using Allegiant for travel.

When I asked the agent at the desk to print my boarding pass she demanded that I pay for another bag. All I had was my small personal item and a paper bag with food in it ended up leaving my bag with my dinner in it because I didnâ€™t want to pay the $50 charge for another bag. So ridiculous. It says right in the rules that you are allowed to bring food in addition to the personal item. Clearly an untrained and extremely rude employee. I submitted a complaint to Allegiant and got nowhere.

Not the passengers. Not the service. I was scheduled to fly from Harrisburg, PA, to Ft. Lauderdale, FL on March 2nd - Allegiant flight #507 leaving at 6:26pm. Without any notifications or warnings, the flight has been re-scheduled 8 times for the departure at 10:45pm (more than 4 hrs delay). At the same time, there was NO ONE from the airline at the gate to convey/explain the delay or to communicate any related information. I've tried to chat with the customer service via the website but to no avail (""sorry, our agents are not currently available""), tried calling the customer service - waited for 1.5 hrs to no avail either. Overall, it is an ultra low cost airline (although I paid a pretty hefty price for a one way ticket - the same as on United Airlines in opposite direction) with a non-existent customer service and the lack of responsibilities.

Then Flt attendant said airport closing for an hour. Back to the gate, deplaned. After a while boarded again. Went to de ice. Never happened. Say for 30 or 40 min. Back to the gate.

Flight is finally delayed until 3/1 at 1 pm. 3/1 1pm no plane2:30 still no plane. in the meantime, their flight scheduled for 31 are taking off. Customer service rep tells us that they are flying a plane in from Pennsylvania to finally take us to our destination over 24 hours late. I've spent the better part of two days now at the Bangor airport and I'm not spending any more and so I asked for my bags back, and I rebook with a flight to Tampa on Thursday evening. And I drag all my bags back to the car and leave just spend another night in the motel and then I think better of what I've done and so I cancel everything, including the booking that I made for the end of March, I'm through with Allegiant.

They would rather save 3 than the many who sat around them behind bothered by the yelling and bad language. The flight back was even worse. The people directly behind us had a medium size dog that whined and yelped loudly the entire 2.5 hour trip. The dog was under my seat so it was even louder for me. The owners only were addressed by the crew when they were caught with the dog sitting openly on their lap. Not being bad enough, the dog was also passing gas. One of the requirements listed on Allegiants website is the animal must be ""non disruptive"". This definitely was not the case and the flight crew was not eager to do anything about it. Not to mention that both of us are allergic and were sneezing. I did reach out to Allegiant with my complaint. Their answer was shocking and dismissive to say the least. They pretty much said, in short, that it's my problem and they did nothing wrong. I asked to speak to someone else and I've been brushed off.

Here is the sequence of comical, unbelievable errors by Allegiant, but most disturbing was the nonchalant attitude with no communication and mitigation to the errors. -Flight was late (not usually that big of a deal). After arriving, she waited over two hours for a ""paid"" check baggage, with no communication at all on eta or reason from Allegiant staff. She had been picked up by a mother with a baby, so they had to call it a night after 2.5 hrs.  A passenger wandered out to the Tarmac to see if he could get info about what was going on .The passenger came back and reported that there may have been an accident with the ground crew, that Allegiant was short staffed, and they had no ETA. At no time did Allegiant send a message to my daughter through Text or the App (even though you have her information, and knew she checked a bag - With no information, and with no-one at Allegiant Airport picking up the phone or calling us back (we left messages) the communication was completely irresponsible and non-sympathetic to the passenger schedules (like college classes). I called twice myself and no one returned calls. She went back, paid for transportation there on the next day, Jan 4th, but no one from Allegiant was there (couldn't you pay for 1 staff to be there to hand out luggage?)  She found airport staff who said they couldn't help, but to come back on Friday the 5th at 9am or 2pm when Allegiant had a flight and therefore staff. Turns out there was no flight in the afternoon, but we were lucky and we stumbled onto that fact, no thanks to Allegiant, so she went in the morning. Why couldn't Allegiant take action to at least communicate? To deliver the baggage would have been even more helpful, even it was for a fee. Why not use the system which knows she checked a bag? Why didn't someone the night of the Arrival come tell the passengers ""we had an accident, we are short staffed, Allegiant doesn't offer services (or care) so come back when we have a flight so that you can stand in line and have an agent help you get your luggage that we will hang on to for 2 days and have you at our convenience come get it, taking a chance on when you arrive because we don't communicate because walking to the waiting customers or sending an email or text is too expensive.

Imagine my surprise when we get a text notification as we are walking into the airport that we are looking at a 2.5hr delay. Great news with two senior citizens and two kids under the age of 11 and one toddler. After looking at FlightAware I found that this was a rolling delay that had been hours in the making. This notification could have been sent out hours before just like any other airline notifies their customers. So, now we are sitting at a small regional airport for more than two additional hours with small children with an ETA of 1AM. Ideal situation. Upon arrival we were told that our baggage would delivered to carousel 3 but instead it was a delivered to carousel 6 (in another building). This was only after entire A320 worth of passengers with screaming tired children waited for over an hour. Our return trip was no different. We arrived to Sanford to be treated by a departure board showing 22/32 flights delayed. Three gate changes one plane change after boarding, three hours of waiting we board our â€œnewâ€ plane. Just like any terrible infomercial, â€œbut wait thereâ€™s moreâ€! After boarding we waited over an hour for them to load the baggage.

I had another flight scheduled to take off tomorrow 12-24-22 and I received a text this morning saying my flight has been cancelled due to weather. The weather tomorrow is in the 40s and Mesa is in the 60s PLUS the other airlines are still flying. After waiting on hold for 2 hours, there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a manager and she said sorry, I would need to call a different number and easier on hold again. Terrible company!

They just announced there is too much fuel on the airplane to take off. They are going to remove the fuel and fly to Tulsa and get more fuel but they donâ€™t know if they can find another flight crew to complete the trip to Florida. Just spoke to the pilot who said the previous announcements were false. The pilot said he will fly the leg to Florida but the plane will have to stop for fuel in Tulsa.

Looking for next day tickets is a fortune and now we are driving 21 hours to make this family reunion a reality. What was suppose to be a convenient and quick trip has turned into 40+ hour road trip and less time with family over Christmas because now I have to leave a day earlier to accommodate driving.

Also another time they flew above the Provo Utah airport and decided not to land even though they could have (I may add though they were worried about potential ice) and took us straight back to Mesa AZ. They then gave us a flight to Ogden the next day. I believe that there is a much better way to administrate this airline and be more respectful to customers.

When I went to use the voucher, it wouldnâ€™t work and I contacted customer service with no response for 2+ weeks. I contacted them again and they told me my voucher had been voided.

Our flight was originally suppose to leave at 4:00 but was delayed due to some reason that was never made clear. After hours of waiting, there was another flight scheduled to leave for this same route at 6:48, but instead of putting us on that plane like they shouldâ€™ve done since weâ€™d already been waiting for several hours, they let the original passengers take flight, while making us wait for our plane to arrive. Our plane finally arrives and we board the plane around 7:10. After waiting for about an hour to take off, the pilot informs us that the vehicle that was supposed to taxi the plane wonâ€™t start and weâ€™ll have to get off the plane until they can â€œformulate a solutionâ€ really? They only have 1 vehicle that can taxi the plane in the whole freaking airport? So that brings us to now, itâ€™s currently about 8:30 and we are all sitting here with no idea whatâ€™s going to happen.

4090,Allegiant Air,1,"""scores minus zero in my book""",5th December 2022,False," I was not able to actually take the trip for the ticket I purchased. According Allegiant's website, changes would be easy to make if necessary and only required a $25 fee. I attempted to make changes on Thanksgiving Day and could not reach them by phone, email, or the chat feature on their website. Hold times were in excess of 3 hours. Understanding this is the case during the holidays, I kept trying to reach them until I finally reached someone 4 days later by setting my alarm to wake me up at 4:00 a.m. so that I could call them. At this point, I was outside of the 7-day window, but tried to explain to the representative that I'd been trying to reach someone well before the 7-day advance notice requirement for changes. The key word here is that I ""tried"" to explain. The representative I spoke to was the rudest person I think I've ever reached in a customer service department. She kept cutting me off and reciting what sounded like a script that she was reading off of her computer screen. By the time she was finished listing all of the applicable fees, she said my $200 ticket was really only worth $23. I asked to speak to a supervisor and again attempted to explain the extenuating circumstances under which I needed to make a change, but she continued to rudely cut me off mid-sentence. Finally I was so angry I just hung up the phone. The airline needs to anticipate high call volume around holidays and still provide a means of communication with its customers. I was assured by the website that my email would receive a response within 24 to 48 hours, but now almost 2 weeks later I still haven't heard from anyone. They should also train their phone representatives to have some common courtesy and allow customers to speak and not treat everyone as if they're stupid. Let me also add I actually drove 45 minutes to the airport to speak to a representative in person, but there was not one single Allegiant employee at the airport that I could speak to.

4091,Allegiant Air,1,"""I will never fly this airline again""",29th November 2022,True,"  My experience flying with Allegiant is my first and last. The ticket agent who checked our bag for the flight down was incredibly rude and tried to bully us into paying 50 for my carry on saying it wouldnâ€™t fit under the seat and threatened it would be 80 at the gate. My bag was smaller than many on the plane. Ended up being fine but she added a lot of stress and irritation to the flight down. Also their bag weight is 10 lbs less than almost every other airline in an effort to squeeze more money out of the passengers who are already flying this airline due to limited funds. On the flight home over thanksgiving weekend we arrived 3 hrs before boarding to reduce stress and ensure no issues getting on the flight. We waited in line for 30 minutes only to be told they would not take our bags until 2 hrs prior to check in. All other airlines are 4 hrs. I was uncomfortable with this and asked about the long line at security as well as boarding being so early and doors being closed 10 minutes before departure on way down. She said you can do priority bag check and the lines at security shouldnâ€™t be that bad. So I am currently stuck outside security with no seats, no food or drinks and stressing out as I watch the security line hoping we can rush through in time to catch our flight. We certainly wonâ€™t have any time for dinner before our 8 pm flight so maybe itâ€™s another way to make us spend money on the plane?

He tried to communicate with the desk representative and could not understand them. They did not have/were not prepared to deal with a deaf person. My son started to panic and contacted us because he did not know what to do. We had to get him a ride back to Lawrence Technical College and are still trying to figure out how to get him home. I guess the $200 they refunded us is supposed to take care of this mess. I've emailed them and I'm now on hold with them for over an hour. This company is really going downhill. I checked the weather at both airports and it's clear. Haven't been given a reason as to why it was canceled. If they can't provide the service then they shouldn't be selling tickets.

The staff in Los Angeles were just okay. Boarding started on schedule and it was very disciplined, and I was welcomed in quite a friendly way by the crews. Take-off was only 10 minutes late, but eventually, we landed half an hour ahead of schedule. Their A321 had slightly larger overhead bins and strip LED lighting, but sadly no personal TVs. The seat was cozy and comfortable, easy to use, and adequately spacious for a 2.5-hour flight like this.

The CSR said it's called a ""Merit"" itinerary (or something like that) and quoted a price about 50% higher than those offered online. The csr had a poor attitude, very terse in his interaction with me and ultimately did not care about my satisfaction. But, I believe it's a larger problem at American Airlines. If I need to travel to a final destination and must connect through another city and flights are published on AA.com in individual segments and are available, why can't American Airlines accommodate the customer and simply book the individual flights at no additional cost to a loyal customer? I've noticed this being true with Award Travel - whoever is in charge of managing the connecting schedules for those customers who need to travel with connections, is not at all customer-focused and needs to attend a few seminars on how to continue to satisfy the customer.

Because of that delay, we missed our connecting flight to Japan. We waiting over 2 hours in line for help and would have waiting longer had I not flagged down a random employee and begged for help. They were able to put us on a different route, adding over 12 hours to our trip. To top it off, they lost our baggage. Our baggage sat in the USA for 3 days before they found it and sent it to us.

Upon the flight being delayed 4 times they eventually cancelled the flight all together leaving us confused because this is the first time we've experienced this issue. Lady at the desk told us to rebook at gate 14 so my husband and everyone else went to gate 14 only to find out we were in the wrong place. After waiting 3 hours in line we found out there would be no more flights from MIA to Boston until 2 days later. Both my husband and I were expected to return to work the following day yet now we are stuck in FL for 2 additional days. I went to another gate that had just boarded near by, a flight going to Rio de Janeiro, to ask if they knew where we could find our luggage and to my shock the 2 women behind the desk were talking trash about the people waiting in the now 5 hour line to rebook cancelled flights. I stood there as the 2 employees spoke to each other saying how the people standing in line are ""stupid because they are wasting their time because customer service wont help them"" and laughed about how they would be going home soon after their shifts. Upset I approached the woman behind the desk and let her know that I was one of the people standing in line and looked at me wide eyed as the other employee walked away I asked her if she could do something besides speaking on people she doesn't know and tell me where I can locate my luggage. She told me I would have to go elsewhere to baggage customer service and ask them and told me to please be patient and I replied just like I was now when she felt the need to make fun of people she doesn't know. I walked away and my husband and I went downstairs to find the baggage customer service and after waiting in line yet again for an hour, another employee walked over to tell everyone in line that we are wasting our time. He announced that all the baggage from the canceled flights were in back and no one is going through them because it's too many luggage to go through. Everyone in line became very upset, some yelling at the employee asking what he meant. One man lost his mind telling the baggage guy that the people from upstairs sent him down here for his bags and the baggage guy told him that they only do ticketing and we do baggage and said they don't know what their talking about and no one from the canceled flights would be getting their bags. Angry I went up to the desk to ask if there was anyway possible to retrieve our luggage, we will now be in FL for 2 days without clothes and bags. Also 5mths pregnant, all of my clothes and other things were in my luggage. The lady at the desk told us she had no idea where our luggage is but she would put some note into the system so me and my husband would be able to pick up our luggage at the customer service desk in the morning. Upon searching for hotels for the night as I am pregnant and refused to sleep in the airport and of course everywhere near the airport was booked up. We found a hotel by luck and got there after 5am the next morning 3 more hours later after using Uber to get around town looking for available rooms. Next morning we went back to baggage only to find out the girls note was overridden and our bags were now in Boston so we had no luggage.

Since I am supposed to get to the airport 1.5-2 hours before the flight, I was up early and arrived at 5:15am. At 5:36 am I received a notification from American that this flight was delayed until 9:45am because of ""logistical issues"". As a result I missed my connecting flight. I was supposed to get into Little Rock for 11:15am and now have a connecting flight putting me in little rock for 8:26pm. Having read the reviews on American Airlines before booking this flight, I should have heeded the warnings. Lesson learned! Wanted to give American Airlines a chance to prove the reviews wrong. I was wrong, American lives up to its subpar reviews. Because of ""logistical issues"" rearrange my transportation, reservations and housing. I have never flown American before and will never fly them again.  I tried to call American Airlines and was on hold for 36 minutes. Never got to talk to a person.

They then decided to go back to the airport. Waited another 2 hours, boarded again, came off again. This happened 3 times. By 10pm (flight was supposed to leave at 6.15pm), so by this time I knew I missed my connecting flights back to Australia. They decided the Tyre needed replacing. No help with organizing another flight for me (4 flights in total to get back to Australia). No offer of accommodation or food. All I got was â€œconnecting flights will be same tomorrowâ€, no new boarding passes issued, nothing. Got kicked out of the main airport area at 11pm, so was stuck in the foyer area from 11pm to 6am. At that time I contacted my travel agent to make sure they had me on the next flight, and they didnâ€™t, she lied to me. So I had to try and find a hotel that would take me at 6am in the morning. The hotel that took me is another story. Desperate times call for desperate measures. My travel agent ended up booking my flights 2 days later, no thanks to American Airlines. (Oh, and they also lost my sons bag for 2 weeks, he only had the clothes he was wearing all that time). Got to the airport and funnily enough the same lady that lied to me served me at checkin. â€œOh I feel so sorry for you, Iâ€™m going to give you an exit row seat on your 1st flightâ€, she said - little did she know I had paid for the exit row seat just hours before anyway, so it was already my seat. So she lied yet again, pretending to do me a favor! So all in all my son was without everything for 2 weeks, they cancelled my flights twice, no accommodation or food offer, no rescheduling my flights after lying to me saying they were, and itâ€™s been 5 weeks and Iâ€™m still trying to get compensated for the Uber costs to and from the hotel, food and accommodation that I had to organise, 1 day of work that I missed.

I have had several bad experiences with American Airlines on both domestic and international flights in the past; old, dirty planes, lack of any inflight entertainment (other than old drop down ancient TVs from what-appears-to-be from the 1960s), inadequate leg room, etc. But the last few times I have flown with them, it was not too bad and the planes were better; cleaner, etc. but I had one of those experiences again! It was like going back to 2011, 2012 with American! Not only was the plane my partner and I flew this time around; both on the flight to and from, old and decrepit (relatively clean, but extremely dated), there was hardly any legroom whatsoever.  This journey was made even more miserable because one of the flight attendants in the back of the plane was rude and dismissive when I had to get up and use the restroom. She told me to ""sit down because of turbulence"". There was no turbulence at that point. It got to the point where I waved up to another flight attendant at the front of the plane if I could use the restroom up there and he was very friendly and understanding and said I could ""but to make it quick before the turbulence"" and sure enough I was able to do so (it was also an emergency). He was so nice, and I was able to sit back down before the turbulence (which got pretty bad at one point), but the other female flight crew member denying me access to the restroom when there was not any turbulence at one point was rude and unprofessional.

My most recent flight with American Airlines was delayed by 17 hours and customer relations refuses to give me a refund. I was/am pregnant and was traveling with my 18 month old son. Our layover between flights was supposed to be only 1 hour and turned into a stressful, exhausting 17 hour delay. We waited until 1 am at our gate when we were told to change terminals entirely to go to different gate. After waiting an hour more at this new gate, American Airlines canceled the flight entirely for that night. We were given an $11 meal voucher and told to â€œbook our own hotelsâ€ and American would reimburse us. Finally at 4 in the morning I was able to get my 18 month old son to sleep at a hotel we had to book and get an Uber to with no help from American. We only were able to stay for 4 hours before heading back to the airport. When we got back our flight was delayed again. We boarded a plane, weâ€™re told to get off and change planes and wait. It was so tiring and during this time no more meal vouchers were offered so I was paying for everything out of pocket. I missed two days of work because of this fiasco. Since this trip from hell, I have been contacting American Airlines and offered no refunds or compensation. The only thing I was given was a $25 credit for my next flight. No I am not kidding. $25! Not even a refund for the hotel they promised to pay for! I quite literally lost over a thousand dollars because of this flight and I do not have that kind of money.

4170,American Airlines,1,"""at least have the decency to be honest""",21st July 2023,True," American Airlines itself is a decent airline, but the fact that approx. 5 - 7% of their flights are direct flights is a capital crime. Almost every trip requires a connection, with about 85 - 90% of those connections being in Charlotte. It is kind of funny that lot of the budget airlines, like Spirit & Frontier among others offer a majority of direct travel all across Canada & The US. How is American Airlines not jumping on this. Honestly, a stopover is not bad, especially if you love flying, like I do. However with American, a stopover is a bittersweet thing. Firstly, a stopover could be anywhere 40 minutes to 1 hour. Hearing that you initially think ""OK, not bad at all"" then you have your first flight delayed for a bogus reason, rendering your connection pointless, which is frustrating. Frustration increases usually because with American Airlines, your first flight will be an evening flight, and after the delay, you get to your connection 1 hour late if not more, and you have to stay all night in the airport to get your connecting flight first thing in the morning. Yay! If you are lucky to get a representative at a ticket booth, which will be few & far between if that, you will be given some sort of miss-information in regards to why your flight was delayed. After finding out that upgrading my seat from aisle to window, would be $54, US as well. That's fun! American Airlines screws up and still wants to charge for trying to rectify the situation. Like us customer are the inconvenience. After saying no, I actually had a representative tell me ""You can certainly book a flight with United"" what kind of answer is that. Your airline messes up and your advice is have a customer pay more money with a different airline. Alright then! WiFi on American is not the best either, unless you are a Xfinity or Verizon member. If not, don't expect any internet access besides the American Airlines site allowing you to check other American Airlines flights to see your connecting flight is on time and knowing you will miss it. Prices for WiFi on the airline range from $15 - $20, just to use the WiFi on 1 device only. Oh Joy! I do realize airlines screw up sometimes, it's a part of travel. The whole ""it's about the journey, not the destination"" thing. However, at least have the decency to be honest with customers about what is going on and try to accommodate them. The very least you can do is try to keep the customer. At least with your own airline. As much as I love flying, a direct flight is certainly better than this headache I endured. American, please get your stuff together. Remember, you are not the only airline in the skies.

I couldn't get a flight change on the phone, luckily I was near the end and got told that my flight was actually delayed? But it literally left when I arrived. Then was told that I was checked in, meaning someone was checked in with my seat before I arrived late. That I paid for. Odd. Finally I got another flight which was delayed by an hour.

4174,American Airlines,2,"""will never fly American  again""",18th July 2023,True," First off, I paid for a first class ticket! A lot of money! I fly monthly and I always fly first class. When I got to the airport I went to scan my e-ticket which clearly showed I have a first class seat. The machine said I was too late to check luggage. It didnâ€™t make sense. I was 2 hours early. A very nice woman helped me and she fixed it and checked my luggage. And I got my luggage tickets and my luggage was marked priority. When I went to check in at the gate I was told to step aside. A female agent said the ticket not in the system despite my having my boarding pass. So she asked a male agent to assist me. He was extremely mean and rude. He said I wasnâ€™t on the flight. I showed him my confirmation email, my e-ticket that showed my seat number and he said it didnâ€™t matter. I donâ€™t exist in in the system. He then assigned me a new seat in economy. I told him I paid for a first class ticket. He said you didnâ€™t tell me that. Ask for a refund. Had he actually looked at my ticket he wouldâ€™ve seen that I was first class. I didnâ€™t want to make scene so I moved on. When I passed through the first class cabin my seat was empty. I do not know if it filled after, but I was one of the last ones on the plane. I imagine it went empty. I probably should have just showed my e ticket and I could have sat down, but honestly I was so taken back by the way I was just treated I wasnâ€™t thinking. I have sent an email to my travel agent to ask her how I can get a refund of the difference. I fly first class because I fly frequently and it helps me to me rested for important meetings. I spend a lot of my hard earned money. I was treated horribly by the agent at the gate. I do not tolerate that behavior and do not reward it with further business. I can tell you, I will absolutely never fly American Airlines ever again and I will never recommend them to any body ever again based on my experience on this particular trip.

But I spent 10 hours at the airport to basically find my own solution. 3 visits to the customer service line and 2 phone calls before I decided this is ridiculous. My first flight out I missed by 5 mins even though I watched them give other stand by people my seat. There was a bad storm that delayed everyone. I was put on stand by 3 times before Iâ€™m like no this can not be the solution. My 3rd visit to customer service was met with limited reps and basically the last rep showing no empathy after Iâ€™ve been running around the entire airport for 7 hours just to get oh no the flight is overbooked. I ended up just purchasing a new ticket through JetBlue and let my anxiety not get the best of me. The reason I missed my flight is because pre-check took 40 mins to get through. No one had a sense of urgency. 10 people missed my flight so donâ€™t you think thatâ€™s a big issue. I get it if it was only me but 10. The same people running from flight to flight.

While in line we heard them give my husbands seat to a passenger in front of us, when scanning our boarding passes they didnâ€™t work, but our checked bags scanned? While in line for customer support (which was forever long) we were the next people in line and a worker pulled two groups to go to a gate worker to get the line down. We said no we wanted to stay, we were next in line. He told us we had to so another 2 hours later we are still in line at the gate and the gate worker had no clue what he was doing. So I went back and stood in line again at customer service. I made it to the front again before my husband moved so I called him to come back over. At the gate the worker would not look up where another customers bag was because they said over and over again that if you donâ€™t make it on a flight neither does your bag. So at customer service we were very nice in which we did not get in return. Asked us why we didnâ€™t know what flight we were on? Told us they rebooked us for 6 pm the next day. There were no hotels, no rental cars. So our only option was to stay at the airport for close to 20hrs. With no solution or compensation or anything. We then asked her if she could check where our bags were, in which she told us that if we didnâ€™t get on the flight neither did our bags. We asked again if she could just check.

We took the train back and arrived to the now correct gate 8 minutes before take-off and were not allowed to get on our 4:50pm flight, We went to American customer service and were told the next flight was after 10 pm and that it had no seats left. Agent gave us two standby passes and said we would not know if we can get on unless two people sis not show up or cancelled and we would not know until 10 pm until the after 10 pm. I asked 'what do we do if we do not get on this plane?' Well we were told we can apply to get a hotel room. Mind you I am 70 years old and dog tired from being at the Nashville Airport for leg one of our journey at 8am that morning, We could wait until after 10pm if we knew we had a seat but not just to be told we were denied. We had to see our daughter! I took an Uber to College Station and the Uber driver drove us over an extra 100 miles to charge us more, which was not the original route or price. I am dealing with that. I called American to see if we could get reimbursed and was told that the I should of gotten on the 10:00 pm flight as there Were 5 SEATS! The agent lied to us!

Qatar tells me â€œAmerican re-issued the tickets on 5th Jul (just 4 days before the actual inbound travel) and removed free checked bag, and thus they had to charge me.â€ After multiple follow ups with American Airlines customer relations, they are not even ready to tell me why they did re-issue the tickets on 5th Jul (booking was done in Feb), and why did they remove free checked bag in the re-issued ticket on 5th Jul.  American Airlines is not even ready to deeply look into what went wrong in their system/process, and not ready to refund ($420 charged total for 4 checked in bags for 4 passengers).

We were delayed at least 40 minutes taking off. Several passengers in front of me knew as we waited to taxi to the gate they had already missed their connection. The pilot and staff were great. The issue is simple to me. Flights that don't run within 15 min early/late run a huge risk of causing passengers to miss connections. The pilot was transparent in tell us they were assigned to a gate, which was occupied. Then assigned to another gate. Which was also occupied. So we waited on the ground about 20 minutes for an open gate. Don't airports have like 900 gates? I find it ludicrous that the delay was made even worse by the inability of the airport.

4223,American Airlines,1,"""horrific disaster""",26th June 2023,False," Our mission trip to Africa was cancelled due to travel in vain. The airline failed to get us to our destination, it is as simple as that. There were 23 of us traveling together, all leaving from Albuquerque. Our American Airlines connection in Dallas was delayed so we missed our connecting Qatar flight which then spiralled into a nightmareÂ of trying to get our flightsÂ rebooked for 48 hours. We were told that our tickets were booked and that our luggage would only go where our tickets specify (by multiple agents from Qatar and American) only to find out when we went to check in that our flights had not been rebooked, and later that our luggage was not remotely attached to our tickets (but halfway around the country or world without us). The nightmare we went through trying to get American and Qatar to talk to each other to make sure our flights were actually booked was an unacceptable fiasco that no paying customer should everÂ have to go through. We went back and forth between the two counters dozens of times only to find out each time that their systems would not work with each other. This ultimatelyÂ ended in our trip having to be cancelled because the airlines could not get all 23 passengers on a flight to our destination before the gate closed. The lack of efficiency was only second to the lack of care and empathy on the Airline's part. The customer service we experienced from AmericanÂ throughout this process was abysmal- agents literally laughed at a hopeless mother of six who had been stranded for two days because of their system's incompetence. We did everything in our power to ensure that we were working within the system requirements,Â being diligent to double or triple check things (even though that is not our job) and get to the airport 5-6 hours early to be safe. None of it mattered. In the end the Airlines failed miserably toÂ treat us like respected customers or even with basic human decency.Â Because of this disaster and being stuck in Dallas for nearly 72 hours we incurred thousands of dollars in expenses (hotel rooms, Uber rides, food deliveries). We hold American responsible for this nightmare, though Qatar played their part as well. If they had not closed the gate on 23 people 30 seconds before we walked up to the gate (and refused to reopen it) none of this would have ever happened. But it did happen, and now we need to be reimbursed for this horrific disaster.Â ",,Business,Economy Class,Albuquerque to Dallas,2023-06-01,2.0,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no,AA

This issue was not limited to a single staff member; the next desk had the same attitude. Since this was a work trip, my colleagues also had the same impression about the whole crew. It's not just about their lack of willingness to work; it's also the attitude that made me feel like I was doing something wrong or that I was an unvalued person who didn't deserve good service. I was not going to write a review but they forced me to do this with things that happened afterward. My bag has not arrived with me. Their staff assured me that my bag would be sent directly to Porto. Trusting their words, I didn't even think about tracking my bag during my 5-hour layover in Lisbon. Why would I? I have learned that my baggage was not even checked into Lisbon airport. Consequently, when I arrived in Porto, I had to wait a long time for my bag. I notified the lost bag department and missed my paid train home. I was exhausted and disappointed, not knowing what to do without my presentation materials. They called me whoever I was talking to (Stacey) was the only good thing about this airline. She was nice. I spent around 60 euros because of them. (paid ticket, presentation materials, clothes etc.) However, the other airline companies I know generally pay compensation right away. Here, they are asking you to fill out a form to claim your money.  It is well designed for you to give up and not be able to fill out the form to claim your money.

4235,American Airlines,4,"""absence of reliable customer support""",19th June 2023,True," I recently had a highly disappointing experience with American Airlines' code share partnership with Japan Airlines. As a loyal customer, I had accumulated over 300,000 American Airlines points, but their redemption process left much to be desired. Despite having a substantial number of points, I was unable to use them effectively or receive the benefits I expected. One of the most frustrating aspects of my journey was no seat selection options, particularly when traveling with children. It is unfathomable that an airline of American Airlines' stature would not prioritize the comfort and convenience of families. With no control over seat assignments, we were left scrambling to find suitable seats, causing unnecessary stress and discomfort. Adding to my disappointment, there were no options to upgrade, even when I was willing to pay for an upgrade. This lack of flexibility was particularly disheartening considering the length of my journey. Traveling from the USA to Vietnam with a layover in Japan for over 9 hours meant that comfort and quality service were crucial. Unfortunately, American Airlines/Japan Airline failed to deliver on these fronts. To make matters worse, the return trip mirrored the same problems. The absence of reliable customer support was particularly frustrating. There was no one to turn to for assistance or to address our concerns. This lack of accountability and communication left me feeling abandoned and unsupported throughout my entire journey. Furthermore, both of my flights experienced delays during boarding. This additional inconvenience only served to exacerbate an already frustrating experience, leaving me questioning the airline's commitment to punctuality and customer satisfaction. In light of this disappointing experience, I am left wondering about the value of retaining my American Airlines points or why anyone would choose to remain loyal to the airline. The inability to utilize my points effectively and the overall lack of customer-centric services have seriously diminished my trust in American Airlines. I sincerely hope that American Airlines takes these concerns seriously and addresses the numerous issues faced by their passengers. Until they demonstrate significant improvements in their services and customer support, it is difficult to recommend them or have faith in their loyalty program. Please note that this review reflects my personal experience, and others may have had different encounters.

I was traveling with my entire family and small child and they totally displaced us causing a domino effect of chaos for our travels to a foreign country that we have planned for 10 years. It was very unprofessional way that they handled the situation, and they were just dumped me off to the next supervisor who would then dump me off to another supervisor. Youâ€™re unwilling to give me any type of compensation for the chaos that they created and thatâ€™s just unreasonable in my opinion and unprofessional in business.

So my connecting flight in DFW will be missed because I arrive at 1140am and my connecting flight leaves at 1047 am. The DFW flight I paid for a seat which means nothing to AA.

7949,Delta Air Lines,1,"""luggage had been lost""",26th July 2023,True," My mom and I flew from Boise to Seattle for a little vacation get away for the 4th of July. We left on 7/3 from Boise on a one hour, straight flight to Seattle. When we arrived, we discovered that some how my mother's luggage had been lost. I'm not sure how that can possibly happen on such an easy flight. We had to wait at the Delta baggage claim for 3 1/2 hours for them to finally tell us they would open a case. They had no idea where my mom's bag was. Our plan was to fly into Seattle, get a rental car and drive about 2 1/2 hours away to Ocean Shores. This put us way behind schedule and left my mom with NOTHING - no clothes, no toothbrush, no heart medication. She trusted that Delta would get her bag to its location. For Pete's sake, we weren't taking an international flight with layovers! The next morning Delta called and said they located my mom's bag but that they couldn't deliver it to us because we were too far away and they couldn't ship it via UPS because it was a holiday. By the time Delta would have been able to ship my mom's bag to us, we would have already been returning to the airport at the end of our short vacation. My mom paid to check her bag both ways ($60) just to not have any access to it - plus the stress of not knowing where it was, waiting for hours, and the inconvenience of having none of the items that she brought to accommodate her vacation. She had to spend about $150 of replacement clothes, toothbrush, etc. I contacted Delta after the trip and requested nothing other than that they refund the $60 we paid to check the bag both ways. They would only offer a flight credit good for 12 months.... UNBELIEVABLE. We will not be flying in 12 months so I again asked for a cash refund instead. They refused.

My flight from Indianapolis was delayed for 30 min but was still on time to get to the connection in ATL. The connection flight was delayed as well for about 1h, then finally we boarded the connection flight. The pilot then told us that there is something wrong with the engine that they would attempt to resolve the issue. About 45min later the pilot told us that we will be asked to deplane as this issue would not be resolved today. He also said that he had been flying for 16 hours straight and would not be able to take us to our destination even if they found another plane. The customer service line was extremely long and after 1h30 AM wait, an employee told us that unfortunately there was no more voucher for hotels. At the same moment we all start receiving rebooked flights notices for 9:30pm, so we were to stay at the airport for 20h. When I spoke to the staff they were very dismissive. I informed them that i have a hip issue and could not sit or stand for so long but they told me to go find myself a hotel and maybe Delta would refund me $100 of it. I asked that they get me my luggage back because i needed to take my blood pressure medication but they said i would have to wait until it arrives in MD. I bought a ticket with Southwest for $200 and was able to get home.

I do not eat that, coach had chicken Caesar salad, chicken salad sandwich and some sort of charcuterie option! Now granted they were going to pay extra for ordering any of those but I paid ahead by flying first class and had one nasty option. The flight attendant didn't like that I don't like Caesar salad and gave me attitude the rest of the flight. We also had no WiFi. Going into Hawaii every family needs agricultural forms to fill out, this flight didn't have enough forms and NO pens! They told us a million times the flight was full, so take your own advice and have enough stuff for everyone. They made everyone who did not have a form stay on the flight until they got more forms and filled them out. As a first class passenger with my bags tagged priority they are supposed to come out first, we'll they came out almost last!

This was an absolutely terrible experience. My flight was delayed, and we were told at the terminal that it would be ""at least an hour,"" and that it would probably be longer. I went to eat something and came back in an hour, and the plane was gone and the terminal empty. At the Delta desk, I was told it had gone. They said other people missed it as well. Of course, they had announced the flight over the intercom and sent passengers an email, but where I was told it would be ""at least"" an hour, I ate without listening to the many constant announcements or checking my phone. Delta booked me on standby for a flight late that night, but unfortunately did not inform me that it was an overbooked flight. There was no room on that flight. I had to travel late and stay the night in a nearby town and wake up the next morning for another flight, traveling on little sleep. I had to reschedule one of the most exciting meetings of my life with a new mentor. We met that night much more briefly, with me totally frazzled and stressed. So essentially, I spent extra money on food and transportation, lost sleep, missed work, wasted many hours, had to travel late and stay overnight, had a panic attack in the empty terminal, and missed a once-in-a-lifetime meeting with a hero and new mentor of mine. I understand that these things happen and reached out professionally to Delta, and they emailed me apologizing and saying they would add 3,000 miles to my SkyMiles account.

We went back to the counter, and the counter person took quite a while to find a solution that would allow us to arrive at our final destination, Phoenix. We were somewhat confused because other airlines (JetBlue) still had flights that were flying out that night to JFK. The counter person finally found a solution for us. The solution involved sending us to a hotel, where we would spend one night. Then from the hotel, a taxi would pick us up and drive us 5 hours to a completely different airport (Punta Cana.) We did make it to the Punta Cana airport on time and were able to get on a flight to Dallas and connect on to Phoenix. One of the stresses that occurred was that the hotel that the Delta ticket counter person sent us to was full. When we arrived at the hotel at 11 p.m., the hotel manager said that there were no more rooms available. After more than 30 minutes, they were able to squeeze us all in 1 room, with my daughter sleeping on a cot on the floor. The following morning, the taxi driver (that Delta provided) was a very unsafe driver. We were in the taxi with him for 5 hours. He drove all over the road, cars and buses honking at him, he talked on his cell phone, stopped to buy street food, asked us for gum, and when he dropped us off at the airport he asked us for a tip 3 times. We gave him $10 but he truly scared us the whole trip.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Phoenix via Dallas,2023-06-01,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,DL

For my 4 year old to not be seated next to someone she knows is unacceptable. It took a passenger to speak up and trade seats with my 4 year old to sit next to my Mother.

The flight was confirmed on time throughout the day. Just as we walked into LGA, DELTA canceled the flight. Waiting on Long lines to find out what DELTA will do to get us home. Also on phone, maybe another airportâ€” what about other NYC airports, Newark, Philadelphia, Washington â€” nothing available. What about flights to any city in Florida and we can drive from there? Nothing? Check the trains, nothing available. Did DELTA have a responsibility to get us home? The airlines answer was NO. Can we take the next available flight to anywhere in Florida? Sure, DELTA tells us thatâ€™s in 5 days on Saturday. Hey airlines â€¦ we work, we have responsibilities, a life to get home to, our dogâ€¦ what about that? What about my Medallion status as a loyal customer? No doubt, DELTA airlines stranded us with no options without even an apology. No apology sent to my Delta app, email, nothing! No refund sent to my card either for that matter. In all my decades of air travel, I have never seen anything like this. Delta claims the massive cancellations are due to weather, which they cannot justify on the east coast route. Today still stuck on account of the supposed â€œbad weatherâ€ â€” thereâ€™s no hurricane, tornado or even a thunderstorm. The sun is bright. As of now, weâ€™re driving to Richmond for a flight we found on Jetblue to Fort Lauderdale on Thursday. Thatâ€™s means 2 days lost just trying to get get home. Our flight to NYC on Sunday was also canceled but DELTA kindly re-routed us and we did finally make it to the wedding albeit late. Iâ€™m concluding there is a systemic problem.

We waited in that hot smelly aircraft for two hours. Every 30 mins he said we would depart. The steward stayed behind the curtain as we all moaned for air due to low air quality on the plane. A few of us mentioned we felt like passing out. Then they brought out hot water. So what seemed like 3 hrs later they cancelled our flight and many flights. So hundreds of people had to stay overnight. Everyone wanted updates and a new flight. They told us no new flights. We waited in hours for phone as service that offered flights the next day. All the airport agents ran off it was too overwhelming. So I stayed the night at the airport on a bench. Canceled work the next day. All the next day I was walking and talking and checking my phone for updates. A few agents were nearby and set up new flights for me. But every time I checked on my flight it was always at a new gate. And my name was never in the system or the flight donâ€™t exist in their system. It was so weird. So going around in circles. Some agents flat out ignored me. I grab lunch at this blue square blue restaurant.  I also ate at this Parisian style breakfast place. Meet a waitress who connected me with the right people to finally get an actual ticket for me out of sfo. So the next day I boarded a plane at 5pm. Again it was another delay.

However, in actuality there was another craft found and so the delay would only have been two hours. Upon learning this, I went back to the helpdesk and pointed out this information, but they said I could not be put back on the original flight and no refund was possible.

8005,Delta Air Lines,1,"""Delta mistreats its customers""",12th June 2023,True,"  Months ago I bought these tickets, a single reservation paid with a single credit card. To our surprise, at the time of pre-check in the day before the flight, my husband appears assigned to row 30 of the plane while I appeared in row 18, I think. We decided to arrive at the Boston airport early to try to get seats together and there they tell us that we should try to do it at the boarding desk, we were waiting there until a Delta employee showed up there and with a very bad attitude told us that we had to wait until 3 PM without guarantee to talk about this and he got to talk on the phone for an hour and a half. After 3 PM, he simply left and left me and 4 other people waiting in line because their boarding passes did NOT have assigned seats. We waited and waited and when we saw that the screen said that the boarding process would start in 20 minutes and there was no one there, I went to the desk of the next flight to tell the lady from Delta that there was no one to attend us and the screen It said that the boarding began in 20 minutes. She called on the phone and finally another employee came running and told me that if my husband and I were on the same reservation, she would try to seat us together and she kept both boarging passes. The passengers began to board and I had to remind him that I did not know which group I belonged to because I had 2 assigned seats in very distant rows and it was there that he verbally told me that we would be together in Main Cabin 1. When they called that group, we still did not know what were our seats but in the middle of the row the employee finally printed the tickets that I show in this review. In the middle of the flight, when I went to the bathroom, I saw that all the people who were in line with me waiting to see which seat they were going to be assigned, were sitting in the last rows. The truth is that I do not understand why Delta mistreats its customers like this. I think that everyone, even those of us who pay for cheap tickets, deserve a minimum of respect and consideration.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Lauderdale ,2023-06-01,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,yes,DL

I didn't want to have to disclose the fact that she is special needs because I thought they would accommodate but they couldn't have cared less. I had to check in my carry on luggage because of no room in the overhead bin.

What is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE is that as compensation for a lost day of vacation, lost day of rental car and lost night of hotel we were offered 8000 Sky miles points for two of us (who are NOT sky miles members).

I made sure to buy my ticket in person ($600 one way) over the phone to make sure every requirement was met. Avoid this airline if you are a woman traveling alone, are traveling with a pet or have a fishing vacation and plan to travel with your rod and reel.  Although I bought an ""airline approved pet carrier"" and checked and rechecked dimensions (experienced with a tape measure) I was informed the carrier was too large and I would need to buy one there (unsure of mark up but willing to pay whatever the cost). I was kept at the counter a long time while the agent and her supervisor searched for a carrier to sell me. They were out and told me I would need to book a later flight while they obtained one. This was not an option because my son was already in Utah. I called my daughter back to the airport to take my cat to my ex as she is unable to keep him. Returned to the counter where the supervisor loudly told the ticket agent to find out what I had ""done""with the cat. I checked two bags one being my son's camping gear where the supervisor informed the ticket agent that my sons rod and reel couldn't be in his pack and security would determine if I could carry it with me. It was only a $100 rod but had tremendous sentimental value. Security said it was fine and people take fishing trips with their gear. I made it to the gate (I was over 2 hours early) after it had already boarded and the supervisor met me there to inform me that she herself would not allow me to board with the rod. I put the rod in garbage can (she continued to argue for a later flight while they ""obtained"" another carrier). All together this 4 hour one way economy flight cost me around $1200 and I was made to choose between my son and my best friend of over 8 years. I can't tell you the trauma this has caused me because this woman was desperate for whatever mark up or commission she got from that carrier. I miss my cat all day everyday. You can save a lot of money choosing a different airline and worst case scenario you receive comparable service.

I give him a platinum delta american express. He says, oh but this one is only good for when you fly internationally, you need to have a different platinum american express, or you can pay $50 for a lounge access. I ask why I am supposed to present any card at all to access a lounge with a paid first class ticket? He comes back with: ""well, in order to access a lounge you need a first PLUS class ticket"". So this is where I ask: Delta, have you completely lost your mind?! My response is this would be the last time I paid x4 business fair (vs an economy seat) for your not so comfortable domestic business class seat.

We were downgraded and given seats in different cabins. We are seniors and our medical conditions require us to be together when traveling in case of problems. While trying to explain that to the boarding agent she was rude, uncaring, and refused to listen to the issue we were having. Absolutely no effort was taken to try to fix our issue. She asked us to step aside and then after everyone else had boarded she said to take our assigned seats or lose them. Luckily a very kind man sitting next to my wife did hear what we were saying at boarding and offered to switch seats with me. We have not received any compensation nor offer thereof for the downgrade at this time. On the plane flight attendants repeatedly ignored request for something to drink. In SLC I decided to double check our seats that were confirmed just 12 hrs before. Our seats had been sold out from under us. We had no seats on the plane at all.

Especially since THAT flight was substantially delayed. Got in to DFW 6 hours later than planned. Return flight, delayed just enough that the only flight to be on time, the last leg, taking me home, was already pushed back when I got to the gate. Delta kindly rebooked me on a flight the next day and of course, no room. Fortunately the gate agent found a seat on a flight later that evening so I only have to wait 5 hours. I assume they used the same computer and data base that Delta Corporate uses, so I am not sure why the company didn't book me there in the first place. Going back a few months, I had a flight get delayed and delayed and then finally they sent me a text that it was delayed until the next morning. Same scenario, no help for accommodations and since they ""delayed"" it, well that's not the same as ""cancelled"" so they have no obligation to help or refund. In that case, I had to be in the destination city before the flight was scheduled to depart so I rented a car and drove all night. I only flew Delta this time because they were a ""preferred airline"" for the corporate travel department I was booking through. I cannot fathom why. Now, the staff at Delta are all very nice, they are as helpful as they can be, but there isn't much they can do when flights are delayed. So thanks to the staff. But your airline sucks.

I also did not realize my Fanny pack that was only carrying my phone was a bag. She was raising her voice and getting my kids upset. We shoved his stuffed animal and my Fanny pack into a bag and then she said my mothers purse which was smaller than my Fanny pack was a bag then grabbed one of our rolling bags and told the other woman working there to â€œcheck it inâ€. She said â€œyouâ€™ll get it when you get offâ€ then pushed us through. The guy behind us who was on the flight explained since itâ€™s a connecting flight we would pick it up at the turnstile in Albany. It was very stressful and so upsetting to the entire party. The staff onboard were not friendly and the plane was dirty. I was told not to fly Delta but unfortunately the flight was cancelled through the other airline for returning so my choices were very limited. My flight to Orlando was with Jetblue and they had the same written instructions on the website for bags and we did not have any issue with a Fanny pack, a purse and a stuffed monkey being counted in our bags.

The flight was delayed for almost 5 hours. What's worse is that they changed the boarding gate and we went to that boarding gate in which different flight was scheduled to fly. No announcement over the speaker was made regarding the flight. Then they sent updates via email but it was already too late. No compensations were made. This is such a terrible experience.

8038,Delta Air Lines,1,"""a complete disaster""",5th May 2023,True,"  I had the nightmare flight experience from Delta Airlines. My recent trip from Boston to Shanghai was a complete disaster. Delta Airline flight DL509 got delayed 3 hours and made me arrive late in Los Angeles from Boston. This made me miss my connecting flight to Shanghai with China Airlines. Second, Delta Airlines changed my entire trip without notifying me. I found out my flight changed the next day from my travel agent. Delta changed my entire trip and made me use their airline to fly back to China instead of flying with China Airlines. The new trip now forced me to fly to Seattle and then fly to China through Delta Airlines. This forced me to stay in a hotel for 2 nights and the 2nd night hotel I had to pay out of pocket. Third, Delta Airlines then tried to make me purchase a Main Cabin class ticket for the 3rd day flight to China on their Airlines. This was an $800 ticket which they said I have to purchase in in order to get on the only next available flight to China. So, for them making me miss my connecting flight I had to pay $800 just to fly back and also I had to spend $200 the second night for a hotel in Seattle so I can catch the flight to China the 3rd day is ridiculous. Finally, when I took their flight to China on the third day and arrived in China they lost my luggage. I had important items in my luggage which I had to give to my relatives and now its gone and they are still trying to find it. Delta mentioned specifically that I did not need to worry about my luggage when my flight got changed by them. This entire trip made me feel like a helpless homeless person for 3 days and as an old 70 year old man my health deteriorated greatly from the stress they caused me. Thereâ€™s no shame in the horrendous customer service they provided and I was never compensated by Delta Airlines for the distress they caused me.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Shanghai,2023-04-01,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no,DL

8040,Delta Air Lines,8,"""Overall the flight was good""",3rd May 2023,False,"  April 5th we travelled from Sydney to Mexico City and Cabo to Sydney on April 25th, 2023. We booked premium economy after looking at reviews. I've travelled Premium economy with Air Canada once previously. Sydney to LA was very comfortable with the foot rest and ample room. The seats go back far enough for me to sleep quite well. We received a menu and could choose from 2-3 options at dinner and breakfast. There were different wines to choose from as well. Food was great and it was so nice to eat off plates with proper cutlery and not be knocking elbows. The flights from LA to Mexico City and Cabo to LA were also great. What we didn't realise that because we had booked Premium Economy on our main legs we were in comfort class on the shorter flights. More room, designated cabin storage and choice of snacks. So that was a nice surprise. On our return flight from LA to Sydney there was a marked difference in the quality and choice of food and wine. We had a two choices for main one being vegetarian and no choice for breakfast. The dessert was a small slice. I asked for some fruit but none as forthcoming until breakfast. There was only one white wine offered that being Chardonnay which I don't like. Delta advertises wine and food choices for premium economy and did not deliver on the LA to Sydney leg. We did get noise cancelling headphones to use which was good but just be aware you cant use them with your devices only the entertainment provided so you still may want to bring your own. Also internet did not work LA to Sydney but did Sydney to LA. The amenity bags from LA to Sydney included out of date lotions and vouchers. No access to the lounge which United does include in its premium economy offers. Our return flight was changed to a 7 hour wait in LA so it would have been nice to have had lounge access for something that was not our fault. The Sydney to LA flight was late leaving and we had a 2 hour window to collect our bags , recheck them and get to another terminal to catch our flight to Mexico City. Luckily customs was quick but the baggage carousel stopped and needed a maintenance person. It didn't look like we were going to make it. I know Delta would have to book us onto the next available flight if we missed our flight due to no fault of our own but that does create booking problems. As we ran to the gate the boarding closed sign was up but previous passengers had told them we were on our way and we were able to board. Just! There was no allowance or help given by Delta for something they were responsible for. In hindsight a 2 hour time frame does not take into account any delays so a 3 hour window would be much less stressful or stay overnight in LA. Overall the flight was good, especially Sydney to LA. As we have gotten older we have decided to travel in more comfort and Premium Economy does supply that. I'm nearly 6' tall and no longer as resilient to cramped sitting although our run from one terminal to another with full luggage was quite impressive if I do say so myself!",A350-900,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to Mexico City via Los Angeles,2023-04-01,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes,DL

I booked through an agent in Morocco, was supposed to return in May but the Delta airline (not me, not the travel agent) changed my dates of travel which messed up everything, then they tell me because I didn't book through them specifically they won't do anything about accommodating a different day since I couldn't travel on the day the gave me. How messed up is that, this mega airline is so shameless that just because I didn't book straight through them even when it was them that changed my dates, they won't do anything which totally messes up everything for me, do they care? No! Their attitude is(what they kept saying) you didn't book through us so we can't/won't do anything about it!

They simply rebooked our entire family on separate flights. We originally had a direct flight and now had to have layovers in separate cities to get home. The reason for the cancellation wasnâ€™t weather related rather it was because they are understaffed and didnâ€™t have a crew to man the plane. From what I was told and read online itâ€™s due to Delta forcing the vaccine on their employees and the employees either resigning or are fired. Their choice of compensation was issuing 10,000 miles which is essentially $100. This cancelation forced us to miss Easter with the rest of family. The part that is frustrating is they knew there wasnâ€™t a crew to man the plane and waited until the following morning to rebook everybody and give no notice only a time for check in. Needless to say this sounds like something Southwest or Spirit would do, not Delta.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Detroit,2023-04-01,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no,DL

I asked the agent whether they can upgrade my seat for the inconvenience since I payed to insure my ticket. The gentleman sent to a lady and she said she â€œI upgraded you to Comfort+â€.

8045,Delta Air Lines,1,"""FA completely ruined my flight""",30th April 2023,True,"  I believe that this will be the last time we fly with this airline. To start, every passenger made it on time but the pilot caused about an hour delay because he didnâ€™t show up and we had to sit and wait after boarding for Delta to find another pilot. If you know the captain isnâ€™t here or running late donâ€™t squish everyone onto your cramped plane. Then I happen to be sitting next to the emergency exit and was trying to make sure I had the procedure of opening the emergency door solely by the illustration in the pamphlet when the delta lady butted into my conversation with my wife to correct me by mentioning the door will open itself after lifting the lever and I would go with it if I was still holding onto it. I jokingly said I guess Iâ€™d be the first off. Apparently her sense of humor is poor because then she threatens to move my seat and gets short with me. She said not to be snarky but she takes her job seriously. Thatâ€™s fine I get taking you job seriously but learn how to communicate better and donâ€™t come across like such a bitch maybe. That FA completely ruined my flight back home with her nasty attitude. I bit my tongue to avoid it coming to a situation like Iâ€™ve seen only on social media where police come escort passengers off the plane. After my little run in with the lady in 13d (your employee) I can almost understand how those situations arise. Oh yeah, and they charged us for our luggage for our flight there and our flight back. My wife used her delta American Express and was informed when checking our bags that we shouldnâ€™t have had to pay. Considering all of these issues Iâ€™ve had on ONE flight I do believe we will consider other options when it comes to air travel.

Both flights left on time and all the FA's seemed like they were enjoying their jobs with a smile on their faces. Drinks and snacks were served from SFO-ATL twice on the 4 hour flight. Then on 4-26 and 4-27 going back to SFO, everything went smooth once again. I would highly recommend flying with Delta Airlines. Twice a year I fly these routes and I have never had a problem with one of my flights with Delta.

The flight was to leave at 6:15 in the evening but around 530 we were told that there was a weather problem and would be delayed until 7 oâ€™clock. At about 6:55 they change the delayed time to 720 and the plane started to load and was completed by about 730 or 735 and we left the gate headed to the runway. While on the runway we got ready to take-off but then the engines were cut back and we returned to the gate. They said that the weather had closed and they couldnâ€™t take-off , they also said that they had been notified that the pilots time has run out and that they would have to have new pilots so we sat on the plane for about an hour and a half until the new pilot got there. They said they were having problems getting clearance to leave the gate, but by the time they did surprise, the attendant time had run out and now we had to wait another hour while they found new staff. We finally left at about 1030 getting us home at about 1210 where we shouldâ€™ve been home a little after eight I donâ€™t understand how they couldnâ€™t see the time running out coming for both the pilot and the crew well before it was the time to leave it just seems like poor management. I could understand the weather problem, but the pilots time running out within minutes of taking off doesnâ€™t seem to make much sense and then the attendance time runs out like nobody knew that was coming very very unhappy with that situation.

A glorified bus ride. Whatâ€™s more upsetting is the whole â€œgoing greenâ€ charade to cut cost on elements that are so fundamental to the passenger such as food. They provide meals with this sort of pre-packaged configuration where you get useless wood silverware that makes eating completely difficult. Lack of trays makes eating a super annoying task. The portions are a joke for a 10 hours flight, and breakfast is just replica of the American â€œbeef pocketsâ€.

Please do not fly with Frontier Airlines. Even if you save a few dollars on the ticket price you will almost certainly pay more once you add the fees for a seat on the plane and luggage. I have flown with them before but definitely learnt my lesson this time around and will not be flying with Frontier ever again.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Islip NY Long Island to Orlando,2023-07-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,F9
10100,Frontier Airlines,1,"""met with great difficulty via the app""",21st July 2023,True,"  It wasn't that the voucher number didn't work, but rather that there was no time/place to enter it throughout the new transaction on your website/app as per instructed in the voucher email. The only thought I have is that the app went through a new update as the one I have been using the past few days clearly had a new interface and somewhere in the translation, the process was changed or buttons not added properly in the html etc... prior to launch? My hope is that the voucher can be added to the flight I already purchased for tomorrow. In other news, while attempting to cancel my earlier flight from today, I was met with great difficulty via the app (possibly resulting from the aforementioned update?) After going in many circles with the chatbot and waiting something like 35 min for a representative to arrive on the chat, I got frustrated and began searching for a phone number online to which I found a number claiming to connect me to the Philadelphia airport Frontier desk, but rather, connected me to a third party scammer who ended up ""canceling my flight"" with you somehow (likely getting a refund of some sort themselves) while simultaneously charging me an additional fee to cancel. While I don't expect any kind of reparations for that as it was a result of my own impatience/frustration. I'm guessing by my talks with other frustrated customers, that they are equally frustrated when trying to resolve issues with your airline, which can't be good for business. Having been a supporter of your airline in the past and knowing of your former bancruptcy claim, and fully understanding the role of chatbots, etc.in today's society; I fully believe that an investment in more customer care personel, empowering those people to resolve things beyond the standard voucher system and realistically solving all the other issues with unreliability that seemingly are plagueing your airline as of late so that the necessity for resolvement becomes negated is the only way through your current situation. Will I recoup from the loss of a few hundred bucks and my elevated stress levels and missed appointments, connecting flights and opportunities to use my time how I so deem necessary? Of course, but I (and the rest of your dwindling customer base) really shouldn't have to.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Denver ,2023-07-01,1.0,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no,F9

Prior to entering the bathroom, one attendant shared how much she ""hate this plane"".

On 7/19/2023 at 11:40pm They sent me an email for delaying flight from Houston to Phoenix about 11.5 hours. Frontier airlines offered me a refund and change flight options. They did not offer any hotel stay or something. I had to get refund because change flight options are not appropriate for us. All our plans changed and I purchased another airline company ticket from Houston to San Francisco on the same day by paying extra $300. At midnight I was dealing with resolving my son flight to San Francisco about 2 hours. It was a terrible experience with this airline and 11.5 hours delay disrupted everything.

If you can afford a better airline or maybe save a bit more for a different airline then do it! I have been so stressed out with this airline that I literally have a migraine.

10108,Frontier Airlines,1,"""the worst flying experience""",18th July 2023,True,"  By far the worst flying experience of my 45 years. The first flight from O Hare was canceled after multiple delays, and they finally agreed to reroute me through a city 200 miles from there! Since I was expected at my destination, I took it. 2nd leg had a slight delay also, but I got there 24 hours after expected. 2. Flight back had 2 legs as well. 1st leg again delayed. No mention of 2nd leg was made by staff, but the layover time was enough that I made it. Or so I thought. The flight from Atlanta, which was supposed to be at 10:27 PM, was announced as delayed to 11:20 PM. OK, I thought. No biggie. At 10 PM, they announced it was delayed to 2 AM because they didn't have staff. Here's the kicker. If they found staff, they would leave earlier. So passengers couldn't move from the gate. No meal vouchers for this 4 hour delay. Clock kept ticking. 12:30 AM, I went to get some coffee. Came back. The board at the gate says departure at 12:25 AM. All passengers were still waiting, but I panicked and asked the agent, and he says, sorry, mistake. It's at 2 AM. Then, all gate agents left. 1 AM, 1:30 AM, 2 AM... 100-plus passengers are at the gate desk, calling out for someone to come and update us. I started talking to their online agent.  No customer service telephone line. It takes 15 minutes to get one online. He closed the chat unexpectedly. Ok, let's say it was an accident, but given their behavior this far you get the point. I try again. It takes 10 minutes. The agent says all their systems are down, and she can't tell me what's happening with my reservation. I tell her, I'm asking for flight status. Surely, you have that. Or air traffic control would have something to say. She keeps repeating all systems are down, and she cannot tell me more. I ask for a supervisor. She won't get me one. 3:15 AM, someone shows up at the gate desk and says they're just waiting for pilot. Passengers are really panicking by now and asking why we aren't being kept informed. The 2 agents who came out smirk at the crowd and say they don't have to let any of us fly. They say the pilots have to wait out the time before they can fly again and ask all of us to move to a different gate. Okay, passengers agree, and we walk. 3:27 AM, I get a text saying flight is at 3:30 AM. Then, gate agents leave again from the new gate. They come back around 4 and say flight canceled. We can go to ticketing counter to get refund or reschedule. Oh, you also have to get your checked in luggage. If you know Atlanta airport. I get my luggage and go to the ticketing counter all the way at the terminal entrance. Huge lines. They say next flight to anywhere in Illinois will be in 2 to 3 days. At that point, I ask how much will I be refunded, because another ticket booked with another airline for just that short leg would cost 3 times as much. Answer is: I don't know. If I choose to stay (at the expense of 2 lost vacation days), will I have hotel covered? Yes, but meal and hotel won't happen until 3 PM. Remember this is now 5 AM for a 10:27 PM flight, and all passengers have been awake through the night because of their stupid conditions.

Everything is automatic thru a website. So the flight was several hours late. I missed my connection. No refund was issued. Then the return had to be changed. I was charged both a charge fee for 99 dollars and a cancellation fee for 99 dollars. They double dipped and would not refund even one of the fees. I would have been ok with either a change fee or a cancellation fee but not both. So then I bought a whole new ticket so I actually paid them 3 times for the flight. In summary, an original 112 dollar ticket became over a 400 dollar ticket. It would have been cheaper to just use a reputable airline like American. On top of all that they stuck me in the middle seat. Now once again I tried booking a new flight with them and they cancelled the 9 pm flight and offered me a 6 am flight. That did not work with my schedule. They also cancelled the return.

10130,Frontier Airlines,1,"""We will never fly Frontier again""",13th July 2023,False,"  My family had pre-purchased tickets departing West Palm Beach Sunday, July 9th at 8:46PM. As we were arriving at the airport at about 6:00 we received word that our flight was cancelled. We were told that we could not get another flight out of W. Palm Beach until Thursday, 7/13. We were handed a card that we could use to process a refund. The person at the ticket counter was working alone, and, since her terminal was not working was unable to help us other than to tell us we would have to find another flight ourselves. She phoned a superior several times asking for someone to come help her with the long line of angry customers that had, by now formed behind us. No one showed up. We eventually went on-line with our cell phones and determined that there was a flight leaving from Orlando Tuesday 7/11 and we booked flights. That meant we had to rent two cars, drive to Orlando, and then rent two hotel rooms for two nights. The flight that we booked leaving Orlando at 10:30AM was delayed multiple times, the last time because they needed to get a refreshed crew member to the airport, did not leave until after 11:00 PM Tuesday night.

The guy at the counter said â€œOK well I will take your bag off of your hands for $155â€. Tickets might be a little cheaper on this airline but trust me they get you in the end.  If you want to choose your seat, itâ€™s anywhere from $40-$65, if not, they assign a seat for you randomly. We had a 6:00 AM flight and TSA did not open up until five it took over an hour to get through security, which is not the airlines fault, but then we had to run for the plane and barely made it on. If you donâ€™t check in at least 24 hours before the flight online, they will not check you in. There was a gentleman at the counter next to us that had the same flight as us but he did not check online and they bumped him to the next flight , thatâ€™s horrible!

Given no choice, I left the desk, filed for refund, and booked a different airline at that last minute for a whopping price to reach the destination.

I was irritated that I was charged 104 per bag but at this point we had no option as it was approaching boarding time. Then we were in line to board our flight (no announcements made at any point that boarding had begun) boarding tickets in hand, when the woman in front of us for whatever reason boarding ticket wouldnâ€™t scan. The woman working for Frontier and scanning boarding tickets then proceeds to close the door to the ramp to board the plane.

Mind you we were in line with everyone else and the door to the ramp was still open. We had zero control over how quick or slow the line moved. She then tells us that the plane is full and our seats are no longer available. That we would need to rebook. I have called their â€œsupposedâ€ customer service line which doesnâ€™t even connect you to a Frontier agent. They have an option to file a complaint online, which I did, and I received an automated response that it could be up to 7 days before I receive a response. The staff were extremely rude.

I was expecting a typical budget airline experience, filled with negatives to occur. The flight left within 15 minutes of departure, which is considered on time in the industry. We arrived on time in CLE. Contrary to recent news reports, the gate agents were not enforcing bag size/weight check at the gate when my mom and I were boarding the plane. Frontier got new seats and these a lot comfier and better than the old seats, now with a better sized tray table! Itâ€™s nice to have a direct flight to CLE from SAN for us. Far better and calmer experience than LAX. It was a great July 4 experience! Great deal too, the airfare itself excluding extras was $59, though those did add up quickly, but we know that when choosing an ULCC. Ex: Carry on was $65, seats $28/per person. Beware though , they charge $1 more for the middle seat! Why? Also not all planes have the new seating yet, but hopefully itâ€™s coming soon.

There were no lines because everybody was confused, extremely slow, and instead of checking us in yelled at us, to which they then shut the entire station down causing multiple people to miss their flights and offering no substitutes.

On June 30 we had booked a flight to Punta Cana from the Miami airport, and from the counter to check luggage and documents the service was bad, we spent about an hour and a half in that process where there was a huge line of passengers and only 3 members of the airline attending. The flight was delayed, when we got on the plane we were already 40 minutes late. Inside the plane we waited for about an hour or maybe more, and they gave us many excuses as to why the plane was not taking off until finally they told us that we had to get off because it had a damaged engine, after waiting two more hours in the waiting room they canceled the flight without offering more alternatives, most of the passengers had reserved hotels in Punta Cana that they lost because of Frontier, others came from other states or cities in Florida.

10173,Frontier Airlines,1,"""misleading and deceptive practice""",30th June 2023,True,"  Frontier is not and will never be my go to airline, but I went to them because I recently purchased their Summer Go Wild Pass that I have only been able to use once. The pass allows you to fly for about $15 each way but you are only allowed a personal item (which is about the size of a kids backpack and you cant choose your seat.) anything else will cost extra. Apparently they made changes to their website to now almost no flights are available for anyone using the Go Wild Pass but the seats are available if I were purchasing a regular ticket. I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction and frustration with the Frontier Summer Go Wild pass, which I recently purchased in good faith. It is with the utmost disappointment that I bring to your attention the sheer unavailability of flights for the utilization with this pass, rendering it effectively worthless. This has not only wasted my time and money but also tarnished my perception of Frontier Airlines as a reliable and customer oriented airline. Despite the enticing proposition of enjoying flights for a mere $0.01 each, I have found that almost every flight that I attempt to book using the Go Wild pass is inexplicably marked as ""not available."" This flagrant lack of availability stands in stark contrast to the same flights being readily accessible for regular purchase. The fact that the flights I am interested in are supposedly accessible under normal circumstances only deepens my exasperation. Let me emphasize the tremendous inconvenience and emotional distress caused by this egregious issue. As a customer, I places my trust in Frontier Airlines when I opted to purchase the Go Wild Pass, expecting a fair opportunity to utilize the benefits promised. Regrettably, my experience thus far has been nothing short of an elaborate hoax, leaving me with a sense of betrayal and frustration. Frontier Airlines must be held accountable for this misleading and deceptive practice, which is an affront to customers who believed in the value of the Go Wild Pass.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ontario to Denver,2023-05-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,F9

The line was very long, but they were understaffed, not organizing customers by priority, and asleep at the wheel, we waited for 1 hour and they say last call for Denver, 15 people raise their hands and they do nothing. They don't start a separate line to get these people through the bag check so they can get through security and get to the gate. They were already boarding and we are stuck in the Frontier line with the supervisor in the back and the counter under staffed. People were saying they needed to check their bags or they would miss their flight, having been in line for a crazy amount of time. Frontier did nothing about it. We and 6 other people arrive at the gate rushing like crazy 12mins before take off and they had closed the boarding. Next we wait another 30 mins to speak to a supervisor who hands us a Get a Refund card of which we are not eligible for because they say it was our fault we ""missed the flight"". Infuriating. It was Frontiers fault!! The only compensation they offered was a next day flight for $99 each travel time 10 hours, for a 4 hour fight. Ridiculous! We had to get home.

The flight was pushed back twice and finally cancelled at the last minute. What made it so bad was that all flights were booked up until Wednesday night at 10:47. This would have left me stranded in Detroit for almost two more days. I decided that the best option would have been to get a rental car and drive to Atlanta and drop the car at the airport so I could arrive in Atlanta around noon time. That cost me 170.00 plus 86.00 in gas. That's around 250.00 plus in addition to the inconvenience of driving. All Frontier offered was a $100 flight voucher that you could only use on their airline! No hotel option. No help with travel expenses. Nothing! Lots of people have been complaining about Frontier lately. If they don't become more customer friendly, they will be out of business soon.

10177,Frontier Airlines,1,"""not worth the cheap ticket""",27th June 2023,True,"  On June 26, 2023, my flight to Trenton NJ, via Raleigh Durham, was cancelled. No explanation was given, but we found out later it was due to severe thunder storms. This can't be helped. We were told at the gate to go back to the ticket counter to re-book or cancel. I went to ticketing and asked a Frontier agent where I needed to be for re-booking. Her response was ""Over there"". She didn't indicate where 'over there' was, so I asked again. Same response. I said, ""Do you mean behind this woman (who was in line)?"", and she said ""No. Over there where the person in green is standing"". So I moved over to the end of the line. One by one we were moved to another line for rebooking and after about 30 minutes, I, too, was moved. I stood there for another 20-30 minutes when a Frontier employee walked over to us and informed us that if we were to re-book, we needed to be in the original line, the one we'd all just left. I tried to ask him if we were expected to go to the end of the line, but he interrupted me and said he would answer question once we all moved. I tried again. Same thing. Another passenger tried for clarification, and again, the very rude response. And once again, someone tried to ask, and once again, he interrupted before the gentleman had a chance to get his question out. I finally said that I was not going to the end of the line because I'd already been there once, and he then told me, ""Then you won't be re-booked"". Not one of us was angry or rude or disrespectful. We were appalled at his behavior toward us but no one was complaining about the cancelled flight or the long line. Some folks had been there for two days. Of the dozen or so standing around me, we all commented to one another that we would never fly Frontier again. After moving over to 'the other' line, I went back to the Frontier employee and asked his name. He interrupted again, saying he'd answer questions when we were all in line. I told him I didn't have a question other than could I please have his name. At that point he looked at me and said, ""I don't have to give you my name"". That's when I cancelled my ticket. Never, in my 72 years, have I witness such complete and utter disrespect to a group of people, and for no reason. Frontier Airlines deserves the terrible reputation it has. It's run on a bate and switch mentality. Just take a look at it's website. It has absolutely no regard for it's customers. Try finding a phone number where you can actually speak to someone. It's airline employees must hate their jobs, if their 'customer service' is any indication. I'm fully aware that these employees had probably had a couple of tough days, but what about the woman in front of me who had been trying for two days to get back to her kids? There was no respect or regard for her at all. This was my first and last experience with Frontier. They should be ashamed of themselves for the total lack of professionalism they display. I wonder what corners they cut on their aircraft. It's not worth the cheap ticket. Life is too short. Note: This survey requires I rate the on plane experience, which I cannot do since I never made it onto the flight.

I had already arranged my schedule to revolve around the trip as in my work, my kids classes, etc. The flight was a two way to where I got to Denver then get on another plane to reach my destination. I got to the airport and I was suspecting on why there wasn't as many people there, but I didn't think much of it. I got on the plane and we were getting ready for take-off and a lady said ""get off the plane your flight was cancelled"" I was confused on why others weren't getting off either and she told me it was for my second flight. I asked if they had another plane that was going to go to my second destination and they said no. which was weird because shouldn't there have been a delay? They told us to reschedule 3 days after which meant , waste of 3 days where I could've been working, waste of 3 days where my kids could be going to class, and waste of 3 days off our trip. I scheduled it and got home. I read the reviews and I could not find one with 5. That was another red flag and I was thinking of refunding it instead and taking a better airline I was familiar with. I went to the airport, they weren't there. I called using the airport phone and left a voicemail. They never answered. I emailed them. They said I had to wait 7 DAYS. Which meant my whole trip.

10870,Hawaiian Airlines,9,"""really carry the spirit of Aloha""",27th May 2023,True," Hawaiian Airlines is really the airline to fly with between the Hawaiian islands. There was a hiccup on my experience but it was handled very well. Terminal 1 in Honolulu had been completely refurbished from the last time I had visited 10 years ago, and feels very modern, airy and welcoming, but less ""island-style"" - simple and relaxing, which is what the other airports around Hawaii feel like. Security took less than five minutes, and there was plenty of seating at our gate. I had two trips with Hawaiian, from Honolulu to Lihue/Kauai and Honolulu to Kahului/Maui. Both these flights are what I would describe as ""up and down"" flights, literally 3 minutes after we reached cruising altitude we already started our descent. One of the funniest things that I realised was that on both trips, the flights out of Honolulu was operated by the same aircraft (N483HA) and left from the same gate A19. When I asked the gate agent on my second trip about the aircraft's registration, I told her ""I flew this exact plane and left from this exact gate to Kauai two months ago!"" She was extremely nice and joked that I should buy it, since it was ""my plane."" That really made my day. Onboard, even though these aircraft are around 20 years old, they did not feel too old, and the 2-3 seating configuration is great for couples and families. I definitely recommend choosing an A window seat when departing from Honolulu to get a great view of Waikiki beach. The seats themselves actually don't recline and have a small drinks tray - no way you could get any work on your laptop done. Considering the longest flights these planes do are 45 minutes, I don't see any issue with the bus-like seats. The surprising thing is that during these ""up and down"" flights, the flight attendants still come round and offer passengers water, juice or coffee, the latter only on morning flights. Even with the limited service due to the short flight time, I still had great interactions with the flight attendants. The return from Kahului/Maui was a bit of an issue, where all the flights that day got delayed due to a storm in Honolulu. I went to the check in counter to ask if they could rebook me onto an earlier flight, and I was rebooked at no extra charge. Hawaiian Airlines' operation has a lot of quick turnarounds giving very little leeway for delays, the knock on effects went on for hours. However given how quickly the agent was able to rebook me onto an earlier flight (and luckily I didn't end up in a middle seat) it shows that they can handle a crisis very well. Indeed the flight they had rebooked me onto was still delayed, but it meant I got into Honolulu an hour earlier than if I was still on my original flight. Overall, Hawaiian certainly excels in terms of its product, and beats other US regional carriers by miles. They really carry the spirit of Aloha onboard and I would definitely choose them over Southwest when flying Inter-Island, except if I needed to check any luggage.",Boeing 717,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Kahului,2023-04-01,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes,HA
10871,Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""structured incompetence""",22nd May 2023,True," Where to begin? First leg of flight initially delayed. That is not my complaint. Came in after supposed departure of connecting flight. Was told by gate agent to stand in line that would take at least an hour, while the connecting flight was still boarding but not told that! Found out by going to the gate instead of waiting in line. They let me on. All my bags did not make it however. Filed a claim at airport on Maui. Was provided a number that doesn't work. Still trying to reach a human and when I do they pass me off to another number that starts with thank you for your patience, but we are helping others and then plays music that is from WW2 cabaret with no response while asking me if I would like to participate in a survey after they don't help me. So here I am with 3 lost bags, no one to help track it down and no one at that airline is hired to care. It is structured incompetence, insensitive employees on an airline that has a monopoly on this island for most inter-island travel. Not sure what to do next as no human ever responds on their phone line, which is recorded for training persons. My best guess is they immediately fire anyone who actually helps!

When we arrived at the gate, we were told it was delayed. Then, we were moved to another gate. No one ever provided updates. We sat for hours to later find out the flight was canceled. No one from the airline came out to direct the passengers to next steps. Line for ticketing did not move. Luggage did not come out until 5 hours after the flight had been scheduled to take off. I had to book my own flight out for the next day and book a hotel, totalling $1,000+ for 3 people. This is an additional significant expense and hardship for my family. Who knows if and when I will ever be reimbursed. This airline needs to get it together and have a process for communicating to passengers what the process is in these situations.

10877,Hawaiian Airlines,1,"""felt so helpless and disregarded""",8th May 2023,False,"  The flight was a connecting flight to Seattle, WA from Honolulu HNL connecting in Maui OGG. The Maui to Seattle flight was delayed by over 4 hours and we were not informed or notified in any manner. We had arrived from Honolulu and were waiting by the gate when we noticed the departure time change. I was traveling with my wife and 9 month old son and we did not expect this and didn't know what to do since this was our first time travelling with him. My wife went to inquire about the situation and was told by the manager/chief at the gate desk and they said ""there is nothing we can do"". She was worried because we did not have any baby food left or formula and it was frustrating. I went to speak to the same manager/chief and ask if we could get any assistance because we would have to sit in an airport with an infant for an additional 4 hours on top of the initial 2 hour of our flight. While I was talking to them they called security and threatened to get us thrown out of the airport because manager said she will not speak to us because ""we could not understand even is she tried to explain it"" I believe she was trying to imply we were incapable of understanding her and we need to move out of the way so she can help other customers. Shas just gotten another frustrated customer who was yelling and screaming at her and being hysterical but she gave her a completely different treatment and gave her another flight since she was from there and decided to flight out another time. We stood back and record while the security arrived and started questioning us. This was so frightening for us. We didnt know what was going to happen to us. Were we going to get arrested? were they going to take out infant son from us? what were we going to do in a place that is foreign to us and we did not know anyone there so thats where we were recording for our own safety. We decided to wait it out because it felt like the more inquiries or help we requested it was met with aggression and complete disregard of our infant child. We swore never to travel there ever again because we have never felt so helpless and disregarded and treated so poorly compared to others.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Seattle via Maui,2023-05-01,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,HA

10879,Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""stressful and unnecessary situation""",8th May 2023,False,"  This was such a stressful and unnecessary situation. My husband is Navy and we were stationed in Hawaii in February of this year. Hawaii has very strict pet laws, so while I got all that sorted, our cat lived with a friend on the mainland. I finally booked a flight with Hawaiian Airlines for May 5th for my friend to fly our cat out to be with us, and just to double check that I had all my ducks in a row, I called their customer service line. I went over everything with the representative on the phone, including asking her specifically if our cat was good to fly on this flight and she said yes. I even offered to pay for the ticket ahead of time, which is insane that they don't let you do that, it is first come first serve since they only allow 4 pets on the plane at a time. We get off the phone and I am content that I did everything I was supposed to. My friend drives an hour and a half to Atlanta airport, gets there at 3:30am for her 6am flight, and the front desk denies a ticket to our cat. All they can tell us is that there is an error in their system and they cannot book her a ticket. They were incredibly incompetent. I was on the phone with her the whole time listening. They were rude to my friend and told her to just go the gate without a ticket for our cat! They held her up so much that she had to run from the train to her gate, and then come to find out they had the wrong gate printed on her ticket so she missed the flight anyway! We got on the phone with customer service and mind you, it's 11pm where we are. We then spend the next hour explaining what just happened and asking Hawaiian to fix it, and eventually they get us to a very nice manager named Joyce who helped us schedule another flight for the same day at 10:35am. Time comes for our friend to buy the ticket for our cat for the new flight, and the same problem happens. It took another hour for us to get a straight answer from front desk; Hawaiian Airlines had booked both flights with JetBlue as the first leg of the flight, and Hawaiian Airlines does NOT allow connecting flights with other airlines to carry pets. You'd think a manager on the customer service line might know that before booking our tickets and wasting more of our time. So if she had made it to the gate in time, they still would have turned our cat away. At that point we told our friend to just go home. My husband stayed up until 8am on the phone with their customer service trying to get them to fix us another flight for the next day, but they told us the only way they could do it is if we purchased two separate round trips and arranged for the times to line up. There are no nonstop flights to Hawaii that allow pets that fly out of Atlanta, so she would have had to stop in Seattle. There are so many risks involved in buying tickets that way, not to mention possible delays, going back through TSA when she lands in Seattle and the fact we did not want our cat in a carrier for that long. In the end we just asked for a refund. They gave us an additional $70 (whoopie) for wasted time, and apologized for the ""miscommunication"". We are booking another flight with Alaska Airlines instead. I was devastated, sobbing in the middle of the night because I have been so stressed out planning this for months , and they ruined it in the last hour. Never ever using them again.

I was told they would not through check my luggage to KIX. I had to retrieve all my six bags in HNL, they do not have storage in Terminal 1. Have to drag luggage all the way to Terminal 2, and it's 20$ a piece for overnight storage. Fellow passengers came to my aid with the difficulty in handling my luggage at HNL but the Hawaiian Airlines staff just shrugged it off despite asking for help. The next day when checking in for my flight to KIX at HNL was told I needed to pay for extra bags again but eventually did not have to after some back-and-forth discussions. For Inflight entertainment, ipads are handed out with not much entertainment in them!

My wife and I have traveled to Hawaii every January for the past 15 years and every year I contemplate hiring a boat to take me from island to island rather than dealing with this lousy airline. My most recent experience, I had booked two one-way tickets (Maui - Kona and Kona - Honolulu). My plans changed and I only needed the Kona to Honolulu portion of the trip. Rather than being able to make this change online I used chat, text and three phone calls. After more than 2 hours, I was told by the agent that I had to cancel this ticket and then rebook it completely. I said, ok and asked the agent to rebook the flight for me. I was then told that they couldn't rebook it, but I had to use the credit voucher online. After waiting 48 hours, and no credit voucher appearing in email, I logged in and tried to find the credit. Another two hours of waiting for a chat agent, only to be told that I couldn't book this online and had to speak with an agent. Ok, I call the number....90 minutes later, I'm told that ""because I called an agent, they were going to charge me $25 for each ticket for a processing fee."" So, my ticket that had a value of $116 per person, and I was trying to rebook a new ticket for $39, and I was going to immediately lose the remaining value of the credit, was really only saving me $14 off of just abandoning the original ticket and rebooking online. I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in all my years of traveling. Unfortunately, they have a monopoly when it comes to inter-island travel so you have to use them which I guess is why they can get away with providing such lousy service.

10912,Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""I wonâ€™t fly with them anymore""",4th November 2022,True,"  Iâ€™ve had so many problem with Hawaiian over the years that I had to write a review at this point. It started with them canceling my husbands and Iâ€™s flight during Covid and not offering any sort of voucher for a last minute hotel. If you can imagine, getting a hotel day of on Honolulu is the worst. Talk about cockroaches and a nasty bed. Not to mention being put on hold for 3 hours only to give up, call back later and be put on hold again for hours. That was in 2021. Later that year we purchased tickets and they were unable to check us in as though our tickets never even existed. que going to the â€œservicesâ€ line in the Honolulu airport and coming close to missing our flight - not because we werenâ€™t early but because the wait in the line was nearly out the door. And the employee barely knew what she was doing so everything took forever. If youâ€™re unable to do the job properly you need more training. Now I go to check in in 2022 and they got rid of the check in lines all together and have kiosks and people walking around- you weigh your own bag etc. remember this is all at the Honolulu location. If you have an issue- just go wait in a line for hours and miss your flight. They got rid of free check in bags for military spouses (no other airline does this) the customer service said because they have â€œissuesâ€ with people sneaking bags or something - no, itâ€™s clearly cutting corners. Active duty personnel is still allowed to have free checked bags but they have to go to the line that take 3 hours to simply have one checked bag. So they make you really contemplate if that free checked bag is worth missing your flight! Also all of this with no heads up with changed in policyâ€™s. Unfortunately I already booked multiple flights with them the next month because they pop up the cheapest. But out of principal and their treatment of military and corner cutting I wonâ€™t fly with them anymore. Military and their spouses already have a hard enough time traveling around, paying for way more flights than normal people, so itâ€™s clear how they feel about military. And before anyone says anything about military occupation, we all Know big corporations donâ€™t care about that.

Return flight from HNL to JFK I was told cpap machines are not allowed on the plane. I told the lady I was approved to use it. They called the supervisor and he said it is a safety issue I cannot use it. I said it is only a safety issue if it is used in the emergency exit, and this is not where I am sitting. Told him I was allowed to use it on flight 51 on the way to HNL. He said no I cannot use my machine on an overnight flight, my throat literally closes up from snoring.

Booked first class tickets for the family in row 1 because a representative from their dial-in hotline said thatâ€™s where the bassinet would be. We decided to spend the additional money to ensure our 4 month old infant son (and us) would be comfortable. First, there was no first class boarding. Waiting in line with what seemed like every other boarding class. Second, arrived at our seats to discover there was no bassinet. The bassinet was the primary driver for the splurge on the 1st class seatsâ€¦ If I had seen the old ratty seats in the first class cabin in advance, I would have never opted to spend the extra money. Oh wellâ€¦ nothing the flight stewardess/stewards could do. They were incredibly polite. The plan takes off and everything sounds odd. After about an hour or two in air, we have to turn around due to mechanical failure. We were incredibly disappointed because it was virtually impossible to get our kids into the plane. Weâ€™ll it happensâ€¦ Seemed like onboard crew was not given any information. Meals were served and unfortunately did not have much time to eat before crew had to clear everything for landing. We ended up landing back at LAX with emergency services crews everywhere. Quite literally a fleet of fire trucks. We disembark the plane and are instructed to stay by the gate. We stay there for quite a while. At some point, I notice the agents were no longer at the gate we exited the plan through but at a new gate with a new flight time and arrival time. I ask if this was our new flight and the response was less than enthusiastic. No explanation. No details. Seemed like they were looking to get back to their conversation and I was rudely interrupting. I go back to my seat and then the manager comes onto the PA system and informs everyone that the flight is delayed. I once again go to the boarding desk at the new gate and ask- â€œSo, what are the options now?â€. Answer now is â€œYouâ€™ll get a room, meal vouchers and then come back for a 1:45pm flight. I respond by telling them I would simply go home. I have 2 very young kids and itâ€™s going to be incredibly difficult to I come back that early in the morningâ€¦ what are my options? Answer was â€œwell you can take the room and voucher or notâ€¦ thatâ€™s up to you. If you want a refund, you would have to call. I forget the name of the department they mentioned. Once again very short and semi rude replies. Whatever, weâ€™re now instructed to pickup our bags at bag. I call the hotline and more of the same. Essentially go on the early morning flight or travel 2 days later. No compensation for the lost time, lost money in other bookings, transportation, etc. not that I had asked but their general go to was â€œfile a complaintâ€. In conclusion- planes are old and tatty.

I tried to check in and and baggage for my flights the day before when I received the email reconfirming my flight. It would not allow me. So I called. The customer service rep told me the amount I had paid for said flight was just to ""place my flight on standby"" and the 2 seats I purchased were not actually confirmed. He said this may have been a computer glitch because this never happens or sometimes with HA this happens because people want to pay their taxes for the flight at the airport. This has never happened before with any other airline I have used. I received no notice that my flight was not confirmed, instead I received the opposite that my flights were confirmed. If I had not called I may have gone to the airport to find out there were no more available seats on the flight (customer service rep told me this). This is crazy. I paid another $100 something for taxes. At first I thought it was a scam, but realized that didn't make sense because they had the correct flight info and my info before I have it to them.

I asked him for a Coke while he was serving food and drinks, but then I politely asked him to exchange it for a zero. I used all sorts of polite words when I asked him, so I didn't feel I had offended him in any way. But he reacted to me with extreme impatience. He even stopped, looked at me and let out a loud sigh. I told him I was sorry when he changed it for me. But then the more I thought about it, the angrier I got, because it wasn't my fault at all, and he had no reason to be impatient with a small request from a customer. I can understand that he might have this irritable personality but I don't think that's the kind of personality that can work in the service industry.

After we boarded, still without having at least one parent next to our 2 year old, the flight attendants continued to be rude and unhelpful. They said it was ridiculous that these seats were not together. We agreed but no one would fix it.

We were told by baggage claim services that we had to call the number we were given to talk to someone about what to do, but that our bags were most likely stuck in Seattle. After being on hold with the number they provided us for over an hour before even speaking to a single representative, we gave up with them. They eventually called us way later to inform us that our bags had been at the Honolulu Airport the whole time, but had been delivered to the wrong place. We finally got our bags back. On our flight back from Honolulu to Seattle, our flight with Hawaiian was so late that we missed our connecting flight. Hawaiian was so unhelpful and refused to cover any costs, accommodation, or anything. We couldn't afford a hotel and ended up having to sit at the Seattle airport for around 5 1/2 hours till family members were able to drive all the way to the Seattle airport to get us before we had to drive roughly three hours to our hometown. Such a ridiculously stressful experience, on top of which: my in-flight entertainment screen never worked on EITHER flight we had with them, there were zero vegetarian options for the free meal they provide for ""dinner"" (not everyone eats pork, Hawaiian!), and the stewardesses seemed incredibly inconvenienced by the simplest of requests.

My husband and I was offered multiple times a companion ticket discount of $100 but when I tried to use it online, it errored out, the website asked me to call their customer service and provided a phone number. I called in, explained that their website keeps error out upon using the discount. The rep told me that they ""are aware of it"", Reasonably enough, she offered to give me one time courtesy of not charging me $25 for using the phone service. Not until the price they offered me is ~$200 extra per person than the web pricing! Luckily, I did the math, and told her that, with the price they are offering me, I am probably better off buying the same tickets online without the $100 companion discount - What a trap! I insisted she to talk with her manager for at least matching the website pricing since I had to call in due to their website error. About an hour later, the rep did call me back, offering a much lower pricing than their first offer. I made the purchase. Only then, I noticed, adding taxes and everything, the actual discount I got is only $61 than my original website pricing, not the $100 discount as their ""earned discount"" offer of $100. Their explanation is: The base pricing for the ticket, since our phone conversation to get the $100 discount took so long (~3 hours), has gone up from $496.56 to $562! So, the actual cost for me to call in is more than the $25 phone change cost since their website didn't work. Yes, the website problem which should cost them in fact cost me instead! Yes, while they are claiming ""No change fee"" yet there is a $25 phone service charge upon anything you want to change, too! What a lying, cheating, blood-sucking company!

10943,Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""Little about this flight was impressive""",3rd May 2022,True,"  We recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary and we wanted to fly to HNL, where we spent our Honeymoon. We purchased First Class R/T tickets on Hawaiian Airlines. Not much about the experience was impressive, and I wish we'd given that $7,000 to the Ukrainian war effort. The agent gave us the gate number but said nothing about the need to line up at the gate and be checked in for a wrist band to avoid having to get screened once we arrived in HNL. About 20 minutes prior to departure we realized that people were queuing up and receiving wrist bands, so we got in line. After having been in line for about 15 minutes, the same agent who had taken our bag at the ticket counter advised those of us still in line that it was too late to be issued a wrist band and walked away. Not only had all of the extensive online pre-clearance effort been a waste of time but we only ended up boarding the flight a few minutes before the doors were closed prior to departure. I was livid before we left the gate and worked hard to not let such a poor showing on their part ruin our vacation before we left the ground. Little about this flight was impressive. The lie-flat seats belong not in first class but in an intermediate class of service. They are 6 abreast in the cabin. The lack of wi-fi at this juncture is inexcusable. iPads for entertainment? Really? Were we eligible to use the first-class lounge? What about the frequent flyer miles? Where would we find them, and can we have Delta FFMs instead? And then there was the food. Two chicken thighs with the skin on in a forgettable sauce was in-edible for me, I never eat dark-meat poultry. That was the extent of the food until breakfast, which wasn't much better. There were no snacks served in between on a flight exceeding 10 hours. Had my wife not brought her extensive survival rations that she typically takes when she flies to Asia, we would have been starving by the time we got to HNL. The return flight was equally pathetic--essentially Chef Boy-R-Dee ravioli without the sauce. It was tasteless and so dry we couldn't eat it all, and it was not a generous serving. Breakfast: also pathetic, we stopped and ate at First Watch on the way home. Like the food, the service was forgettable. Actually, it was nearly non-existent. If you don't ring a call button you won't see a Flight Attendant between meal services. Beverage choice in First Class is quite limited. Hawaiian offers a level of service that resembles Southwest Airlines. Do not under any circumstances purchase a first class ticket. Neither their Agents nor Flight Attendants are trained to provide that level of service. Their cabin interiors are dated and not adequately maintained. There is no WiFi. In Flight entertainment is via iPad, which must be purchased in coach. There is little customer service available from the company - virtually nothing in real time. I've been waiting for a response from them via their website for over a month, which is why I elected to post this online. We liked the fact that we could fly non-stop between Orlando and Honolulu; for less money we could have flown on Delta and, given the lengthy maintenance delay on our return flight we would have spent no more time had we connected in any of their hubs.

During the flight my seat was broken, reclined during take off and throughout the flight making it a very unsafe, uncomfortable and a frustrating flight. In additional to not having the seats we preferred, a seat that was broken, the stewardess had a open bottle of water with no cap and spilled water on my fiancÃ©e as she was attempting to give her trash wetting her entire left side blouse.

10953,Hawaiian Airlines,7,"""I love Hawaiian airlines""",25th February 2022,True," Honolulu to Los Angeles. The trip from LAX to Honolulu was superb. The food was amazing, the service was wonderful, and the lay-flat seats were glorious. I am grateful for their mask and vaccine mandate as it made me feel safer since this is my first time traveling again since Feb of 2020. The trip back from Honolulu to LAX was good, but this time the food was disgusting. They are supposed to have some serious chefs that do their food and I would have given them kudos for the first trip. But the food coming back tasted about as good as it looked. It was supposed to be coq au vin (wine-braised chicken) with green onion chickpea cake. Well, the chicken was the stuff you leave after stripping away the meat from the chicken - the left-over giblets with gristle, fat, and skin. Yuk. The green onion cake had absolutely no flavor at all. You might as well have eaten a piece of the polyester pillow. And those little bitter mushroom things that looked like worms? What are they thinking? Seriously. A true chef understands that there must not only be flavor, there must be a visual appeal. This meal ruined the entire trip and tasted about as good as it looked. I nearly got sick to my stomach. My mother (who usually eats anything) also thought it was repulsive. YUK!! Overall I love Hawaiian airlines and I would fly with them again but they need to get a grip on the food. To Hawaiian Airlines: When you try too hard to give people the ""fru fru"" stuff you miss the ball altogether. Give us some meat with veggies and a vegan option and call it good. No need for the weird stuff. And you'll save some money by avoiding expensive disgusting ingredients too. Stick to the basics.

10954,Hawaiian Airlines,1,"""Worst customer experience calling them""",23rd February 2022,True,"  Not really specific for the flight information provided above, but when I tried to travel the next time (tried to book / cancel). On my previous trip, the flight was delayed by 12+ hours. Due to this, we received travel credits of $300 each for the next flights. Now trying to use this credit to book the trip, and wasted hours and hours due to it. Booked a flight that is 2-3 months away from now to KOA (Kona airport), so I thought the ticket price would be pretty stable. We booked the flight through the Hawaiian website, used up all the credit to save up so we ended up paying $118 each (it was $418 - $300 credit). The next day, we saw the price dropped to $358 per ticket, so we contacted customer service (the call was on hold 30+ min) to either get our price matched or cancel the flight. The customer service representative said I can get $418 full refunded to my credit card, which really didn't make sense so I confirmed it multiple multiple times and the associate confirmed that that is going to be the case. After a week, I only see $118 posted on my card. Contacted them again waiting 30+min again, they said they did refund $418 to the card and asked me to contact my credit card bank to confirm the refund amount. Did that and American Express confirmed that they only see $118 from Hawaiian. Called Hawaiian again, holding 30+ min again, and finally, they transferred to the supervisor (which took another 30+ min). Finally, the supervisor says they cannot do a full refund since $300 was charged by travel credit, and they can re-send the travel credit via email. I complained about my wasted time and also told him to please educate the customer service associate about this non-refundable travel credit information so people like me don't have to waste their precious time, and the supervisor just hung up on me without any answer! I don't know when or whether I'll be receiving my credit, and I really don't want to call them again for the credit not received yet, but I may have to. Worst customer experience calling them, never had a clean flight with them, plus they are usually more expensive than other airlines, so I'd highly highly recommend flying with some other airline.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Honolulu,2021-03-01,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no,HA

Hawaiian Airlines use all of Terminal 1 in HNL airport. Announcements were made frequently regarding flight status and gate updates, really good. Boarding is quite organized and people were called to board by zones. The airplane for flight HA 216 was N488HA, a 23 years old B712. We opted for the over wing emergency exit with extra legroom. The seats are very standard plastic backed type and at the emergency exit the tray tables were located in the armrest. However since the trip only takes minutes we don't really have the need for the tray table. We only bring our backpacks for the flight and were able to put them under the seat in front of us. The overhead bins are on the small side, and based on its size can accommodate slimmer carryon only. We depart around 15 minutes later than schedule (which is a big deal for the 20-30 minutes inter island flights like these) however we land around 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The flight attendants were all very nice and cheerful, and within a short 20-25 minutes flight were able to serve us drink (water or a delicious POG juice cocktail - Passion fruit-Orange-Guava) and collect all the trash within minutes, and we are ready for landing.",Boeing 717,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Kahului ,2022-02-01,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,HA

The incoming airplane arrived early but there was still another airplane at its designated gate; and after waiting for a few minutes they were able to use a different gate so there will be no delay. A relief, since we have to catch a flight out from HNL later that night. Boarding was quite orderly and we were boarded by zones. The flight left on time and arrived in HNL around 10 minutes early. The FAs in this flight were very nice and cheerful, and they have good interactions with the passengers. Within 20-25 minutes flight the FAs were able to serve water or juice for passengers, collect all the trash and getting ready to land again.

10960,Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""HAL got us where we needed - eventually""",19th January 2022,True," We had booked a multi-leg trip through Delta that used ""Partner"" Hawaiian Airlines (HAL) between islands. For their part, HAL got us where we needed - eventually...but not without a lot of wasted vacation time and unnecessary anxiety. 1) An hour before check-in for the next day's flight to Kona we get a text from HAL that our flight was cancelled. Okay, cutting slack for COVID or whatever reason (none was given) we were still worried about how to continue the next leg of our trip. We had no place to stay if we couldn't travel, and expensive reservations waiting the next day. They gave us a Toll-Free number to ""call"", after hours of trying, all we got was busy signal and we never got through. There was no way to rebook on HAL website, since ticketing was through Delta. So, spending 4 hours on hold getting through to Delta we rebooked for a later HAL flight - but had to pay fare difference, even though it wasn't our fault we had to make a flight change. 2) Arriving at the airport, HAL was a mess. Although our reservation included checked bags, they insisted we had to pay because, ""we're not Delta Airlines."" I get that, but we paid Delta - who already paid HAL for our seats and baggage. 3) Finally getting on the plane, there were a ton of open seats. My guess is the earlier cancellation wasn't COVID related, just saving expense to consolidate flights. We were in Economy seats and after boarding, all Exit Rows were open. On any other airline, we've been allowed to move to open seats, but not on HAL. At first, the flight attendant said we couldn't sit there because of Exit Row requirements. I responded, ""as long as we meet Exit Row requirements, why can't we sit there?"" His response, ""more money."" I get it, they market them as Premium seating. After cancelled flights, additional charges and vacation time lost, the least HAL could have done was let us sit there. The Customer Service value would cost them nothing. No. Who sat there instead? Uniformed HAL employees, probably being repositioned. I'm not begrudging that staff deserves to be treated well, but aren't we the paying customers? Through everything it seemed the message HAL was sending was, we don't need you - you need us - so live with it. Easy fix - Obviously, HAL had our cell numbers, because they texted us that the flight was cancelled, due to low occupancy. It would have been easier for them to simply put us on another flight and tell us of the time change. Better yet, since there were only about 30 people booked, they could have called us. Rather than have us keep calling their toll-free and never getting through, one of their agents could have called us (same amount of time on the phone for their agents). We paid a premium for everything on this trip, costs were about 30% higher than in the past. We knew that going in. The cost of more than a half-day of lost vacation time and toll of having your itinerary cancelled mid-trip - priceless.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Kona ,2022-01-01,3.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no,HA

A few things about the Q400: This is not an old or aged aircraft. They are extremely fuel efficient compared to jet aircraft. They can cover shorter legs in approximately the same time as regional or larger jets. They tend to be a bit noisy on the inside particularly between rows 6 and 10 which are nearest the engines. Most of the examples in Horizon's fleet are less than five years old. I like the fact the Q400 can be boarded and deplaned from both front and rear making both processes faster than larger aircraft. I agree that this is not an airplane that you would probably want to spend more than about 90 minutes on at a time. I greatly prefer the Q400 to the Bombardier regional jets also flown by Horizon.

Expect the attendant to take your boarding pass from you and prepare to make your own way to the correct gate when the attendant takes you to the wrong one. Expect to be scolded as if you are a child by staff if you try to complain. Try to keep your valuables strapped to your body at the security check because the attendant may not pay much attention to them at the time. Although one of the flight attendants was appropriate in language and behavior toward people with disabilities the other was obviously untrained in this and very uncomfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,QX

12190,JetBlue Airways,1,"""flight time has changed 10 times""",25th July 2023,True," Do not ever ever ever EVER EVER EVER fly Jet Blue unless youâ€™re into masochism or just donâ€™t want to ever go back home. This is my 3rd time flying with Jet Blue and this is the 3rd time Iâ€™ve experience incompetence with them. Our flight is delayed because of some mysterious storm that I canâ€™t seem to find anywhere on the radar. We were supposed to fly out 9PM last night and itâ€™s currently 12:41 PM 7/22/23. The flight time has changed around 10 times now and was just delayed again to 1:30PM today. I TOLD my boyfriend not to fly with them again, but No. The last time we flew with them, the pilot never even showed up for work and they had to bring a pilot from another airport. Now this flight has been delayed â€œdue to weatherâ€ (which is all they can say) and late last night they changed the time to 3 AM from 12:30 PM. If this is due to weather, how can you just push the time up roughly 9 hours? And then push it to 1:30 pm, and then 12:30 and then 1:30 again? This is by far the worst airline in the world and they have THE NERVE to try to buy another airline. Get your business in order first before you try ruining Spirit Airlines (which I assume HAS to be 500x better than this trash airline). At least this time it wasnâ€™t 10 degrees on the flight, though the Wi-Fi didnâ€™t work. There were no apologies or anything. Also, every flight from every other airline that was heading to New York from San Francisco (which is very close to San Jose, you can see that airport when youâ€™re taking off) that night weâ€™re all fly out on time, no delays or anything.

The last few trips have been maintenance problems with the plane. My trip on July 23rd to Tampa is delayed from 10:18 to 2:40 as they are waiting for a plane from the Dominican republic to arrive. A four hour delay is now common on Jet Blue flights along with cancelations. The email they sent me says it is a 22hr flight to Tampa and the help desk doesn't know why it says that so you have to literally go to the help desk to get information.

I tried a new flight and it's delayed as well. There should be a policy that if a flight is delayed for than three times that it should be canceled. The customer service is horrible in the Santo Domingo airport in Jetblue. You can wait on a line for an hour or more and they don't help anyone or communicate what's happening to the plane. The Jetblue workers in Santo Domingo have attitudes and don't wanna do their job. Jetblue will delay everything and not compensate you when you lose days of work.

Turns out, it wasn't just ours; on the board of flights, over 15 other flights were heavily delayed and canceled. We were all told at once about the cancelation, so we all ran against one another to get in line first, which has barely moved as I write this (over an hour wait now). There was an automatic rebooking, which would take us up to New York (which is being hit by heavy storms), then back down to Florida, then finally to California which makes 0 sense.

I spent the next six hours waiting for a human being to book us on a flight from a different airport. Beyond disgusted with the lack of care shown by the airline and the employees.

They cancel that flight and rebook us from DC going to West Palm. Even though they are still selling flights from DC to FLL and had enough space to book all 4 of us for any of the FLL flights. We find this out as we arrive to the airport. We were notified via voice message 4hrs later. After 2hrs wait to speak to an agent we were told they ""can send us to any South Florida airport they want"" and other passengers (even those without tickets previously) have priority. This is simply a money grab so they can continue selling flights and fill up the low demand flights to other locations. Arriving into West Palm, 70+ miles from our airport, at 9pm, with 2 small children after 72hrs of traveling is acceptable to Jetblue and a true representation of how little they value their customers.

Our flight was supposed to be about 2 1/2 hours from Seattle to LAX. After arriving at our gate we learned that our flight had been delayed by 2 hours. Ok, no big deal. Then another 2 hours, and then again and again. Our flight was delayed for more than 10 hours. After speaking to the gate agent 2 different times, we, and everyone else were told the plane had a mechanical issue and would arrive asap. Everyone was also told they would be issued a $200 credit for the delay per Jet Blue policy. The gate agent said we would receive an email regarding this credit. Nobody was happy about the delay, but at least we would be compensated, or so we thought. After several days without an email about the credit we were promised I called Jet Blue customer service. I was told that we were not entitled to any compensation because our 10 hour delay was weather related. How convenient. Their compensation policy doesn't cover weather delays. I already knew weather delays weren't covered after reading their policy during our delay. I asked where the plane was coming from and they said LAX. What weather delays does LAX have in July? I explained to them that a result of this delay my family lost an entire day of our vacation and lost our car rental since we arrived after hours. Why do Jet Blue gate agents tell us all it was a mechanical issue with the plane (covered under their compensation policy) and promise everyone compensation, then Jet Blue doesn't follow through? Sounds like a bait and switch. Customer service offered us a $75 credit to each of us as a ""courtesy"". I declined the credit because this isn't about a dollar amount for me. This is about a company following through with what it promises its customers. After sharing this story with a friend, they explained that they had a similar experience with Jet Blue. Maybe its Jet Blues policy to lie to its customers. As a result of this, my family will never travel with JetBlue again.

12209,JetBlue Airways,2,"""misguided by the JetBlue agent""",10th July 2023,True," I bought a JetBlue return ticket with 50 lbs of check-in baggage to travel from Atlanta and Boston from June 05 to June 10, 2023. I faced three main problems: 1) After a few days of booking, I was informed by JetBlue that my direct flight had been canceled. They also assigned me a new flight which was several hours earlier than my actual departure time from Boston. I contacted the JetBlue helpline and requested to book another flight (the only option for June 10), which wasnâ€™t direct (rather Boston to Florida to Atlanta). 2) During the online boarding process on June 05 and 10, I had to choose a check-in baggage option and was informed that my credit card would not be charged if I had already paid for check-in baggage. I followed the same process on my return flight from Boston to Atlanta. But my credit card was charged $35 for my Atlanta to Boston trip. After a few days, when I looked at my credit card summary, I contacted JetBlue for a refund. They said they would process my request in the next ten days. But contacting JetBlue support was a very frustrating process: wait time was 45 minutes, and it took me over an hour to report the matter to a JetBlue crewmember. 3) The most important and frustrating thing I experienced on June 10 when returning from Boston to Atlanta. The good thing was that JetBlue informed me that I must leave early for the airport because there was some construction work going on in Boston City; therefore, commuting to Boston airport may take longer than usual. My flight was scheduled for 3:45 PM. Therefore, I left for the airport at 12:00 PM. But when I reached the airport, I learned that the departure was delayed for around 35 minutes. The flight kept on delaying, and finally, I learned that I would not be able to catch my 2nd JetBlue flight from Florida to Atlanta if I flew by the original flight from Boston to Florida. I approached the JetBlue helpdesk at Boston Airport. After more than 90 minutes of waiting, I talked to the help desk official. He issued me a new direct ticket (Boston to Atlanta) for the next day. Upon asking, they informed me that I could book a hotel for up to $250. I booked a hotel for an overnight stay in Boston and spent around $240 (I didnâ€™t eat dinner). Then I contacted JetBlue and sent them the invoice. After ten days, I was informed by JetBlue that I was not eligible for reimbursement because the flight was delayed due to the weather. Why was I misguided by the JetBlue agent that I was entitled to a $250 hotel?

I called Jetblue and they immediately fixed the problem and made sure I flew back home on June 22nd. The customer service rep was so concerned for me she got her supervisor online to help out. My flight was great. I used to be a 20 plus year Southwest Airlines frequent flyer, but due to the cancellation of direct flights from Providence RI to FT Lauderdale Florida I ditched them and have now been a loyal member of Jetblue for the last 2 years. As a frequent flyer of 12 flights per year I also have had a few delays, but were very far inbetween. I noticed that most of the complaints came from casual or vacation planers who are already under an incredible amount of anxiety and stress that comes along with travel. One of the best things for me about Jetblue is the InFlight entertainment that is in each seat rest. Otherwise the flight would be very boring.The snacks and drink selection is always great and the flight attendants are always helpful with whatever you need.

We were told it was because the incoming flight from Las Vegas was delayed. When our plane arrived at LAX JetBlue used that plane to accommodate another flight that was on time. Since our flight was delayed they pushed us back hour after hour with no help or announcements from customer service. Anytime we asked for help we were told there's nothing they can do and they had no idea when we would take off. We still haven't even boarded or been updated in hours so we're at a 5 hour delay and counting. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional.

12216,JetBlue Airways,2,"""experiences left much to be desired""",7th July 2023,False,"  I recently had the opportunity to fly with JetBlue airlines on two separate occasions, and my experiences left much to be desired. While I appreciate that delays can happen, the level of inconvenience I faced on both my outbound and return flights was simply unacceptable. During my initial journey, my flight was delayed for four hours, causing significant disruption to my travel plans. This unexpected delay left me frustrated and feeling as though my time was not valued by the airline. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but the lack of clear communication and assistance from the JetBlue staff compounded my disappointment. However, my dissatisfaction reached new heights when my return flight was delayed for five hours. The reason provided for this prolonged delay was particularly disheartening: the pilot was allegedly stuck in traffic. It is perplexing to think that such a vital member of the flight crew would not have contingencies in place to avoid traffic-related mishaps. This incident gave rise to concerns about the airline's organizational preparedness and overall professionalism. While I acknowledge that flight delays can occur across the industry, the recurrence of such extensive delays with JetBlue has left a lasting impression. The overall lack of transparency and efficiency in handling these situations left me questioning the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction. I must mention, however, that once the flights finally took off, the onboard experience was pleasant. The flight attendants were courteous and attentive, and the in-flight amenities provided a comfortable journey. However, these positive aspects were overshadowed by the significant inconveniences and frustrations I encountered at the start of both trips. In conclusion, my experiences with JetBlue airlines left me disappointed and hesitant to choose their services in the future. While the onboard experience was commendable, the recurring and excessively long delays I faced at the beginning of my trips, including a delay of five hours due to a pilot stuck in traffic, greatly overshadowed any positive aspects. I hope JetBlue takes this feedback constructively and focuses on improving their operational efficiency to ensure a more reliable and customer-centric service in the future.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Newark,2023-07-01,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,no,B6

They canceled that flight and rescheduled me on July 3rd from White Plains at 9PM, 30 miles away. I opted to get the refund and scheduled a flight on Delta for $480.

We had to rebook our entire vacation and connecting flights and hotel in Europe in 3 hours. It cost us extra 2500 usd to change our vacation.

12219,JetBlue Airways,5,"""they lost this customer""",5th July 2023,False, My Review is about Jet Blues administrative policy's. I spent hours picking out the right flight that met my needs for our vacation. A few weeks after booking Jet Blue cancels my flight and assigns me another flight. This new flight the picked for me was awful I would miss a whole days vacation because my original flight landed at 10AM and new Flight landed at 11:15 PM to my destination. My return flight switched from getting me home on a Sunday to a redeye arriving home on a Monday. Just didn't fit my needs and obviously a cheaper flight than I had booked. JetBlue allows you one change however they had NO FLIGHTS nonstop going to and from my destination. I called an agent to try and work things out however things went from bad to worst. They would refund my money but they would only put the money in a JetBlue bank that I could use one for one year. I didn't think this was fair since they made the change and now I was stuck trying to make jet blue work for me. I didn't want to leave money in a bank that I had to use within a year this was my money and they made the change not me. I had to rebook on different days and no longer was there a non stop option they all had at least one stop and a 6 hour trip each way turned into a 10 plus hour trip. Just what I was trying to avoid. I feel like Jet Blue is a bunch of thieves stealing my money and then charging me more money for an inferior flight. Spoke with supervisor and really worthless got the standard line of this is our policy. Whatever happened to treat the customer with respect and make them happy. Not so in this Airlines. I have been a loyal customer for years but lately (last three trips) things have been going wrong and this is the third time my flights were cancelled after taking so much time to plan.

Another hour and a half later, they found another crew. We taxied to the runway then pilot says thereâ€™s a service light that came on. 10 min later that was resolved. Then they said their flight schedule was deleted and they had to wait another 30 min. Iâ€™m surprised we arrived to our destination that day.

Plane air conditioning was not working, the attendants told us that up front. Got on the runway and we got stopped due to weather. Sat on the runway for over an hour then went back to the gate and deplaned. Sat through many more delays and eventually got on plane again. Sat almost an hour before leaving the gate. Got on the runway and sat there for another hour. Still couldn't take off so took us back to the gate once again! Got off and we wanted to just cancel the flight. Would not let us until it was officially cancelled by them. Had to wait through more delays and eventually got cancelled late that night. Had to wait in a very long line to get tickets cancelled and refunded. There were no flights out the next 2 days at least.

After speaking to the representative today, (9 days later and still no email) she said we were not getting compensation, but will not give the full reason why.

I recently checked the travel credits and it's not there. I contacted jetblue. The agent said she has no record of the credit and, anyway, there is no credit for flights canceled due to weather.

12226,JetBlue Airways,1,"""later deny us a refund""",30th June 2023,True,"  My wife and I arrived at the airport 90 minutes in advance, and the flight was delayed 30 minutes, so we ended up 2 hours early. The lines for baggage drop-off were out the door. We used a JetBlue kiosk to purchase two bag tags to check two of our bags; it charged us for two but only printed out one. We were told by a JetBlue employee to go to the kiosk help desk line to address the issue: there were two snaking lines of maybe 20-30 people each, manned by just two employees, and they were moving at the rate of one customer every 10-15 minutes. Were we to wait in that line, we almost certainly were going to miss our flight. So, we elected to use a second kiosk to purchase a bag tag for our second bag in the hopes this one would work; it didn't, but it took our money (again). So, rather than jump from kiosk to kiosk, paying more and more money in the hope that one would work, which is unreasonable, we were forced to wait in line. By the time we reached the front, the JetBlue employee told us that we were going to miss our flight and that, in addition, the flight was ""overbooked,"" so they were going to have to ""rebook"" or ""cancel."" She searched for other flights that day, including through JetBlue, its partner American Airlines, and non-partner airlines; the earliest available flight was July 1. It was the morning of June 28, we had just moved out of our apartment and shipped our stuff to LA, and we were scheduled to move into our new LA apartment that same day, so we would have had to pay for food and lodging for the interval period in Boston--a hefty price--rather than stay in our new paid-for apartment in LA. We explained this to the JetBlue employee, who said that she would cancel our flight and issue a refund for our tickets and bags. I requested confirmation that this would be to our original payment method; she confirmed it would be. There was only one more flight in the entire Boston region that had capacity to take us to LA before July 1: a flight leaving in two hours out of Providence. My wife and I booked the flight, quickly compared taxi and rideshare prices, discovered the difference was negligible, and took an Uber to the airport in Providence, where we successfully boarded the last flight to LA. We later discovered that we had been deceived by the JetBlue employee at the kiosk help desk in Boston; she did NOT issue any refund and instead wrote in her ""notes"" that my wife and I were ""late"" to check in our bags, which was a complete lie and clearly intended to create a fabricated, falsified paper trail to later deny us a refund. We could not check in our bags because JETBLUE'S kiosks were defective, but that didn't matter to JetBlue's customer ""service"" representatives. The fact that we were told the flight was overbooked even though it apparently wasn't didn't matter to JetBlue's customer ""service"" representatives.  We had to fight for hours over the phone to even get our bags refunded; we're still on the hook for the tickets according to JetBlue's ""policy.""

Long story short, we spend over 12 hours waiting as our flight kept getting delayed. I attempted to contact customer service several times but received no update or information. In fact, the customer service chat was very rude. In the end, at the very last minute, our flight was canceled with no information. We were automatically booked on the next flight out the following day. The biggest problem with this story is that I was personally hosting a baby shower for my best friend on the 17th. JetBlue gave us no opportunity to rebook the flight, (and they ADMITTED they knew it was going to be canceled early in the day), nor did they allow us to cancel on our own to reschedule through a different airline. So 4 months of planning a baby shower and a lot of money spent, they had nothing to offer me. I've cried several times over this. To top it off, my husband and I stayed at a highly nice resort, The Excellence, during our vacation, and JetBlue put us up in a motel in Cancun that was not even 1% comparable, and to be honest, a little scary with no security. They also offered us ""dinner"" - a four-plate buffet of stale food at 11:00 p.m. at night. It was absolutely AWFUL. In the end, on the day of our departure (the 17th) we both received an apology email clearly stating that THEY screwed up and it was an ""avoidable cancellation."" They then went on to offer a $100 credit to each of us. $100! What does that even get us? We don't get our time back, let alone enough credit to take another flight! We spent hours at an airport and spending money on food. $100 doesn't nearly cover it.

After the initial â€œweather delayâ€ announcement, the flight crew and attendants were non-responsive to our passenger questions and would not provide any further updates on when we would be taking off. After this 2-hour delay, it was announced that we were returning to the gate because the flight crew could not exceed their â€œflight time hoursâ€. While waiting for an additional 2 hours for a new flight crew to show up but never did, the gate staff were very dismissive and would not provide any updates on our flight departure. We also never received any e-mail or text updates from JetBlue like we did before the flight. After watching our luggage being unloaded from the plane, the gate staff finally admitted that the flight was canceled. After being told to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and to report to a ticketing office to be booked on JetBlue Flight #0066 or on another flight the next morning, we and the other 200+ passengers waited for another 2 hours in a long line while being chastised by ticketing staff to be more patient! After noticing that Flight #0066 was canceled without explanation and after being informed by other passengers that new tickets or hotel accommodations were not being issued by the ticketing staff, it became clear to us that customer service is not a priority for Jetblue so we decided to buy tickets on Delta Airlines at a considerable cost for our return flight home.

However, Jet Blue never sent a rep to inform people of the issue, how it was being resolved or how long it would take. There were a multitude of carousels with people waiting for bags and JB was NO help. They were making announcements over a PA system that most of us could not hear or understand. There were a few JB employees - waiting with passengers. I approached one and asked if he knew what the problem was. He suggested I go to the Baggage Service Office. There were three women sitting there. Not one of them wandered out of their office to explain to everyone at the airport waiting for luggage what the problem was. When I asked she said ""I just spoke with them. They're working on it."" The lack of concern and professionalism was very disappointing.

Now we had to scramble to find the time and money to take a vacation within their expiry period during a global pandemic.

They gave us a hard time for even doing that like we were trying to find some loophole to buy more time (but why do these even expire?). Then we could finally cancel it and receive MOST of our credit back and they sent an email saying the credit will be valid until it expires (1 year per their policy), but they did not list the date on the email. I tried to go back and book a summer vacation using point I knew I had and saw those points expired THE DAY AFTER THE REFUND. I called to ask them to reinstall that credit since there was no warning and customer service hung up on me. I called back and someone at the escalation department was saying it was my fault for not being responsible with the credit! The gall on these people trying to gaslight and steal from me!

I contacted them through their website to request a refund, which was denied on the grounds that they claim that I willfully elected to fly to a different city - this is a completely ridiculous claim, since they cancelled the flight, and the next flight to the same city was multiple days out. No other flights were cancelled or delayed at all that day, indicating no staffing issues. There was no inclement weather on either end. This implies that they must have cancelled because not enough people were on the flight, so it was no longer profitable. It's concerning that US-based airlines are allowed to do this with flights at the last possible minute.

Meanwhile, at the gate next to us, 2 aircrafts scheduled for West Palm Beach, Fl (1 left at approximately 9 and the other boarding at approximately 11) seemed to have no problem. The desk attendants finally let us know that the aircraft was having mechanical issues and that they were working on it.

The check-in process was ok but once on board, we were greeted by an extremely rude and full of attitude airhostess. We were a family of four with two babies. We had to take the long ramp up the flight and I had foldable overhead stroller which one of babies was sitting in. The air hostess kept taunting and making comments on how I should have folded my stroller before boarding. She refused to help with my stuff. She threw my jackets on the floor. After that she started complaining about our carry on and that we should have checked that in as well. They told us they were upgrading us at the check in counter and charged us $500 but there is no business class on Jetblue, its all the same seats. The seats were uncomfortable and cramped, with no room to move or stretch out. Both air hostess gave us attitude till we got off. We were already stressed out as kids were not feeling well. We were treated horribly. We traveled to Punta CAna from NY on American Airlines and such a wonderful experience and service from everyone. Unfortunately, we had to take Jetblue back due to a family emergency but the flight attendants made sure we were treated badly. Overall, I would not recommend flying with Jetblue to anyone.

They are apparently now among the list of worst airlines for cancellations and delays. Not only was our initial flight from SLC to FLL (and then to PUJ) delayed 4 times, it was finally cancelled, for something not only under their control, but something they would have known about for hours and didn't let the passengers know until about 3 in the morning (their phone support even attempted to say it was due to weather, but there were no weather issues in SLC or JFK where the flight crew was coming from, and we even verified that with the airline). Which means we missed our connecting flight. Then they rebooked us taking a completely different route to our final destination (JFK instead of FLL), which was then delayed and delayed and delayed, making the connecting flight a problem once again. We spend HOURS and HOURS on support with them, trying to get everything situated. We missed out on about $1000 in resort time that we had paid for, not including our time, gas, and other things we had to pay for. And JetBlue's response? Too bad, so sad. They took zero responsibility, and very rudely said they wouldn't do anything for us, even after being very calm with them. Pathetic airline. Will never use them again, and will be cancelling our JetBlue card.

All went well till I got my credit card statement and JetBlue charged an additional USD45 for a 4th bag. I phoned JetBlue customer service team explain the issue and after an hour of holding and keep explaining to different people they came back that there is nothing they can do as the mistake was done at the airport and there is no way for them to verify that only 3 bags was checked. I explained I have the email confirming that there was only 3 bags but they still could give me a credit. Its ridicules that their customers cannot pay for carrier on if you are not a JetBlue member and have to pay for checked baggage, we had to pay for seat selection as well on our connecting flight from JFK to YVR to complete the check-in process, money grab.

I tried the site and filling it out twice but the site was not working. It is not required beforehand and this was from an official immigration officer at Barbados) I'm not angry at the people at the boarding desk because I do understand they were doing their job but they refused to let me board the plane until I had this particular document which I could not get at all because the site is not working. A nice manager walked out and had to get on a computer for 20 minutes and by so miracle got it handled so I could board the plane. I was livid and so upset that I was not going to be allowed to board my plane over something that is not even necessary! Truly the immigration officer at Barbados thought the whole thing was ridiculous and everyone else on the plane (coming from the US) was able to fill out their form at customs. They thought what happened to me was insane and did not understand why the San Jose Airport/Jet Blue demanded I have that and almost denied me getting on that plane. The first plane ride was 4 hours and a red eye and absolute hell. They kept the lights on the entire time, and the flight attendants kept coming up and down the aisle hitting me with elbow/tray at least 20 times. They were angry. 40 minutes before landing they start screaming at everyone to wake up and the person next to me in the middle seat had her seat back and was sound asleep with her hood over her eyes. A flight attendant walked up and stood over me to forcibly yank her seat back, yank her hood off and tell her to""wake up. They then just glared at me to remove the bag off my lap while we still had 30 minutes to land. On my next flight to Barbados, no one asked for this stupid entry form when I was boarding which I thought was super comical. I was in a middle seat and when I sat down there was stuff in the aisle seat but no one around. Flight attendants kept asking me over and over whose stuff it was and I'm like don't know. Finally a sweet older lady comes up with a cane and says everybody calm down, I was at the back of the plane allowing everyone to come though because it's really hard for me to get up and down (come to find out the poor lady had a knee injury). Flight attendants were so rude to her. I had been flying for over 12 hours and was extremely thirsty and kept getting such attitude when I asked for water. I asked one male attendant who never brought it to me & when I asked the female attendant a second time for more water in my water bottle and a sparkling water, she rolls her eyes and fills up my water bottle halfway and doesn't give me a sparkling water and just walks away.

One flight was canceled on a Monday which 3 days after they actually opened up the airport. That also means that the people in Las Vegas waiting for flight 607 cannot get back to fort Lauderdale because the flight never gets to Las Vegas! The ripple effects are disastrous JetBlue also has four local flights such as fort Lauderdale to Jacksonville and Jacksonville back to the fort Lauderdale and fort Lauderdale to Cuba and Cuba back to fort Lauderdale (flight number 17, 18 1499 and 1500) and for the past 4 days each of them have been delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours with two of them being canceled all together and weather really has nothing to do with it since April 15th the weather has been fine down here we have had very little rain. But even the four local flights which are only about an hour and 20 minutes apart also been delayed 3 to 6 hours or have been canceled About a year ago Jetblue stated to the public that they will have fewer frequency of flights which will allow them more flexibility when things go wrong but obviously that is not the case.

I booked the flight via Delta who did not include baggage in the ticket price and would not allow me to pay for this immediately - I had to wait until it was time to check in. Very inconvenient. They then proceeded to rescheduled the time of the flight about four times. As a result I had to call them to reschedule to a later flight which resulted in my missing several hours of my NYC vacation. The later flight took off as scheduled but was very old and had the smallest seats I have ever seen and I am a small person. Safety is clearly not a priority for this airline as the flight attendants did not explain what to do in case of an emergency and by checking the safety card I discovered there were no life vests or life rafts on board.

Meal was a very small snack but we landed at 7.15pm so dinner would have been more appropriate. Magazine provided but no IFE. Crew polite and easy going.

Timetable for this flight allows 50 minutes but in reality it is nearer 20-25 minutes. Nice little Canadair jet very bright and clean inside. Left on time and arrived early. Two cabin staff seemed to be playing good cop bad cop. No drinks offered because it seems the flight is not long enough. Its a great little flight that does not climb too high and so you get a splendid view of Los Angeles. Once the plane was parked up we had to walk along the apron to the terminal building.

Due to not being able to locate the crew the flight was delayed by 1 hr at Melbourne. Due to strong winds between Melbourne and Kalgoorlie the flight was diverted to Adelaide to pick up extra fuel. The 5h20m flight turned out to be nearly 7 hrs. These tickets were extremely cheaper than the major airlines. Check-in was simple at Melbourne airport and the flight was extremely good. The Flight Attendants were down-to-earth and worked well for the full flight including the stops. They brought around food many times during the flight.

Light food and beverage served on each leg by friendly and hard-working cabin crew. Aircraft interior trim was a bit worn but the seating was the most generous and comfortable I can remember in an economy cabin anywhere ever - this is how it should be! All up the flight took nearly 6 hours and we had to stay on the plane during stops but I would have had an expensive extra night in Darwin had I flown with anyone else. I got a very good fare booking well in advance but fares shot up to over $800 a week before - perhaps they should review this pricing policy because the plane was less than half full on 2 of the sectors.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,OO

Boarding call clear and we were boarded within 10min from the call. 2 flight attendants for a small Fokker 50 (prop plane) great seats with good leg room and recline. Served a meal of great food. On the way back I was surprised that there was no security check at all! What great trust the airline/airport (Skywest is the only airline to fly to Albany) has in there passengers!

Catering okay and free of charge except if you'd like to drink beer or wine. FA attentive friendly. For the (high) fare you pay you get pretty good service.

18498,SkyWest Airlines,3,SkyWest Airlines customer review,22nd April 2008,False,"In Modesto CA (a city of about 200000) Skywest is the only airline that serves our airport with multiple daily flights to both SFO and LAX (LAX service unfortunately to end soon). Realizing that one can't realistically expect a comfy Boeing or Airbus jet on these short thin routes Skywest does at least get you there - although anyone beginning his or her trip with Skywest or any regional should try to depart as early as possible as these planes easily get backlogged during their multi-segment days and are given last priority to land and big hub airports. I have flown Skywest many times to both airports recently. Unfortunately they use the dreaded Embraer Brasilia turboprop on those routes which is very cramped loud seats don't recline and the ""lav"" (it's a bit of a stretch to call it that) is nothing but a mid-sized compartment that even I at only 5'10"" can't stand up in. There is no running water. The sole F/A must actually crouch under the galley counter to allow you into the lavatory. All of us mid-sized Western city residents will breathe a huge sigh of relief when Skywest finally gets rid of all these dreadful beat-up planes and replaces them with regional jets!",,,,,,,,,,,,,no,OO

At RDM took agent a full 15 minutes to check me in she continually was having to refer to ""how to"" manuals to guide her through the process.

Later an announcement made that those with tight connections in SLC should come to make new connections however my ticket showed RDM-SLC-DEN as a simple stop in SLC same flight number to DEN single boarding pass. You guessed it it was one of those flights that shows up as a one-stop but is actually a different plane (I knew airlines did this on intl connections but didn't think that the regionals did it too.)

They used to fly mainline United (737) on this route but have resorted to more frequent flights (5 a day) on this route with SkyWest. The CRJ 200s are spacious for their size and the FA is usually very friendly and attentive.

18733,Southwest Airlines,1,"""impressed by the witty flight attendants""",25th July 2023,False," I have flown Southwest since I was a child and I am always impressed by the witty flight attendants, flexible seating and free carry-on policy. But alas, I find myself disappointed and distraught yet again. As I write this, I am sitting on the plane because I find the time to act is now. No longer will I sit in the shadows and ignore this issue. There are too many pretzels in the snack mix. It's preposterous. When you hear the term snack mix, you can expect a medley of various chips, crackers and PERHAPS a few pretzels. But what I just ate has no right to be called a MIX. Pretzels plagued my small package and I was overwhelmed. I have fond memories of the old peanut and biscuits that used to be available. Why are they gone? We may never know. Also, though this has nothing to do with the airline, the person in front of me has chosen to recline their seat. Why was this even made an option? And who would do that? I am struggling to sympathize. Maybe I would feel better if I had a well-rounded snack mix in my belly.

18737,Southwest Airlines,1,"""Southwest is not a military friendly airline""",23rd July 2023,True," I am writing as a concerned Officer in the United States Army. I usually only fly with United or American and took a chance with Southwest bc I needed direct flights for my kids. I have three children who need to fly to CA to be with family as needed, ages 5, 8, and 15. Iâ€™ve never bothered to do early check in bc Iâ€™m priority boarding but decided to do it this time since itâ€™s w a different airline then what Iâ€™m use to. My youngest being a 5 year old girl was given a seat in C24 when her brothers were placed in C11 and C 12. So naturally I called the airlines. The lady said she couldnâ€™t change her seat. I asked what about priority boarding for unaccompanied minors (the 8 and 5 year old) she shut that down. I explained I need my kids to sit together please. I asked about priority boarding for military. I explained they have military ID cards and I will have mine on me as I plan to wait with them at the gate to see them off. She said â€œSorry but no priority boarding for them, we donâ€™t do that.â€ She was so rude. I explained these kids are new to this routine and it is the 5-year old first time flying w/o mommy with her. The southwest rep could not care less saying that thereâ€™s nothing she can do for us! I was very angry. Seeing how less than 1% of the population serves our military one would think they would treat military members and/ or their kids better, especially with everything they go through.

18740,Southwest Airlines,2,"""why would I ever fly with them again""",20th July 2023,False,"  The day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from Houston to San Diego. We noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes, so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict. We arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time, so I stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the over-worked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didn't see anything that was better. This phrase came up a lot, but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they don't have control of the weather, etc. regarding delays. The only flights from Southwest that were delayed were those to San Diego (it was not weather related as the flights to and from San Diego were also on schedule except ours). After waiting until we could check luggage (4.5hrs), we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended (5 minute layover). Agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to Boise, but she could only see Houston connections, so I called their 800 number. 3rd agent was an explanation followed by hold/hang-up. 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option, but because we checked baggage #4 (the only person willing to help us) had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information. 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from San Diego to Boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us. I asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection, but that would be unfair to everyone else, so we sat in the back. I knew I was being lied to, but at this point I figured I'd just wait to see what would happen. We fly to San Diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a $100 voucher for a later flight (YAY!). I looked at my pass and it was an ""A"" position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food (terminal was super crowded due to construction) so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit. I mentioned how it was nice that we didn't get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was C-30 and his girlfriend was C-15. I took our passes to the 7th agent (6 was for new passes) and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together. She immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers. I stated that my original tickets were in the A group for that leg of the flight (in an irritated voice), but she stuck to her argument. At this point, I was done with their service, so I expressed to her that I had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored. She threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor. The supervisor #8 and I had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness, but she would allow us to board together. She mentioned the $100 vouchers, but why would I ever fly with them again - I'd pay not to (and told her so). She also asked why I didn't ask for a supervisor - Isn't that their job when they can't help a customer? Flying with Southwest is just not worth the trouble.

When she saw people that she liked, she unblocked the seats and told them to sit there. I donâ€™t know how she decides who deserves the good seats, but i paid $100 for Earlybird check in (me and my wife) so that we would have choice of the better seats. Two other people in my group upgraded for the same reason but they couldnâ€™t get the seats either. And one of those people have hip, knee and back issues and upgraded so that he would have a chance at the good seats (two knee replacements, one hip. replacement and multiple back surgeries) The whole point of paying extra/upgrading, is to get those seats. I feel jipped. And I really hate to say this but there was some kind of favoritism going on.  Furthermore there was another flight attendant that many people said was rude and condescending. People throughout the flight were trying to get to the front lavatories. The 2 rude flight attendants told several people that the restroom was closed. I understand that they were working in that area preparing our drinks and snacks, but they were very rude to my wife and several others when telling them to go use the other lavatories.

Some backstory - I just graduated college and am supporting my fiancÃ© as he finishes college. After doing year-round school, I have about $2,000 to my name in addition to student debt I still owe. Since we are paying for our own honeymoon, we wanted something very affordable. We were planning on just going somewhere local when my fiancÃ©'s parents shared a 48 hour deal for Southwest tickets to go to Hawaii. They offered roundtrip tickets to 4 islands for under $350. We were ecstatic! Since my fiancÃ© was saving for a ring I was in charge of purchasing the flights. I hurried to purchase them but then we found out housing was pretty expensive so we switched out flight to another island on the deal. Little did I know switching made the deal invalid. This wasn't mentioned in the email. I did notice it cost extra but thought the deal was still on there so the total couldn't be too much (this was my first time scheduling a flight and I was under time pressure so I was a bit naÃ¯ve). After paying the difference, I looked a the confirmation email and saw that the total was $1250! I was working so I rushed to an office and got a hold of customer service and they told me that piece of information about changing flight locations. Apparently a lot of people were experiencing the same issue. I started crying explaining that I had no idea the deal wasn't applied and if there was any way I could get my money back. They said that if I canceled I could only get flight credit. I hung up and called my fiancÃ© right away. I was bawling my eyes out explaining how I had messed up our honeymoon and we could never afford the trip at full cost. After that phone call I had to go back to work like everything was okay.

For verification I asked an off duty Flight Attendant what gate we were to fly out of. She looked at my ticket and told me C25 and pointed. We made our way over with me hobbling in horrible pain as it was hard to walk. As it got closer to the time to board I didn't notice any signs of Ft. Myers, Florida so I went to the desk and asked the gentleman what was going on. He looked at my ticket and said I misread it and that my gate was C64 - the opposite end of the airport. We took off at a dead run and ran the whole way even through 3 conveyor walk ways while he radioed ahead that ""there's a woman and two children running your way."" All I could think about was making this flight. As I got closer I heard 3 times, ""Flight 1383 to Fort Myers is fully boarded and if you want to make this flight then you need to come now or the door would be permanently locked."" I was frantic. When we got there the gal taking the ticket asked me how I felt and that I was blue around my mouth and she needed me to get stabilized with oxygen before she would let me on the plane. I received oxygen for about 10 - 15 minutes then boarded. Two flight attendants not only held the plane for me but saved me 3 seats together in the back of the plane.

18757,Southwest Airlines,1,"""never to fly with Southwest again""",7th June 2023,False,"  Allow me to share my recent experience that left me deeply disappointed. My boarding pass clearly stated that I needed to be on the plane by 3:20 PM, as the scheduled departure time was 3:32 PM. However, due to the disorganized nature of the TSA, it took an astonishing 45 minutes for me to place my personal belongings on the tray for scanning. To compound the situation, the TSA officials encountered difficulties while scanning my daughter's belongings. As I anxiously watched the clock, it took them an additional 20 minutes to complete the task. Finally, I arrived at the gate at 3:13 PM, a respectable 7 minutes before the designated boarding time mentioned on my boarding pass. To my dismay, however, the door had already been closed, and I, along with approximately 8 other passengers who had faced similar delays with TSA, were denied boarding. Consequently, I missed my flight to Ft Lauderdale and had to hastily book a flight to Orlando at 7 PM, which landed at 10:30 PM. On top of that, I had to endure a tiring 2.5-hour drive to WPB, knowing that I had work the next day. As a frequent traveler, missing a plane was a first for me, and it has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Southwest again. What truly bewilders me is the stark contrast in treatment when delays occur. On numerous occasions, I have arrived on time only to experience flight delays for various reasons. As customers, we are expected to accept such inconveniences, but the differential treatment when delays happen to us is disheartening. Southwest has unequivocally lost my business. To add insult to injury, I had to personally retrieve my luggage from the Ft Lauderdale airport since I was not eligible for free delivery.

18763,Southwest Airlines,1,"""I am disgusted with Southwest""",1st June 2023,False,"  I am handicapped in that I have significant arthritis in just about every joint and am 85 years old. I asked for a wheelchair when I booked the flight, as I always do. This time when I arrived at the airport in Philadelphia to return home (this was a round trip booking) I checked in at the counter and reminded them that I had signed up for a wheelchair. She told me to sit down and one would arrive. This seemed normal as I have always traveled on Southwest and this was the routine. Well, I sat there for over half an hour, periodically asking a variety of Southwest personnel about the wheelchair. They said it was ""on the way"". When my plane was scheduled to board in 10 minutes I began to panic. When I asked at the desk again, the woman said, ""why don't you just walk?"" I was beginning to think that they thought I could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair I needed. At that point I saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it. I asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she ""worked for ...... airline and couldn't take southwest passengers"". Then she said that If I could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me. She told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate. The plane was boarding. It was very clear that, had I not approached this person and practically begged her to take me, I would have missed my plane, my connecting flight and heaven knows when I could have gotten home. This would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances, not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job. I am disgusted with Southwest and I never thought I would say this, but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs. When I called southwest to complain they said they could file a report internally but they were not under an obligation to provide a pusher for a wheelchair (in this case there was no wheelchair OR pusher) and I know that's not true. If they don't want to provide this service it should not be offered when I book the flight. Then I would go to another airline.

I and several members of my company have been flying Southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing. I have seen its attributes in many way degrade and some of the competitors improve their standards. I was particularly dismayed after having left my briefcase and phone on a flight on May 16th, 2023. After filing a lost report soon after deplaning, I received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing 30 days. Misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical. For this reason, a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from Southwest baggage supervisor at Midway Airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added 40-50 things including I-Pads, phones, and other items. This statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time. With the concern that she displayed, I must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone (regardless of cost) should be undertaken. I would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the Alabama location where all the lost items from all the Southwest flights go (now many thousands of items per day instead of 40-50).

18768,Southwest Airlines,1,"""nothing short of a disappointment""",16th May 2023,False,"  I recently had the misfortune of flying with Southwest Airlines, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of a disappointment. From the moment I stepped foot onto their plane, it was evident that this airline lacks the professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction that one would expect. First and foremost, Southwest Airlines had no regard for punctuality. My flight was delayed once, and then they decided to rebook it for an unreasonably early hour in the morning. This unexpected change disrupted my entire travel plans and left me feeling exhausted before I even boarded the aircraft. It is unacceptable for an airline to make such drastic alterations without a valid reason or proper compensation. To make matters worse, Southwest's servers seemed to be in a state of disarray. Throughout the booking process, I encountered multiple technical glitches and slow response times on their website. It was frustrating to witness a company of this scale failing to maintain their online infrastructure, leading to additional stress and wasted time on my end. The flight itself was another disappointing aspect of my experience. The plane's condition was subpar. Southwest Airlines made a promise to compensate me for the inconvenience caused by their multiple delays and rebooking. They specifically mentioned a $200 voucher, which I was eagerly looking forward to. However, even after reaching out to their customer service department, I was met with indifference and received no resolution. It is disheartening to be on the receiving end of such false promises, especially when they have a direct impact on the customer experience. In conclusion, my experience with Southwest Airlines was marred by their unprofessionalism, lack of punctuality, technical glitches, and broken promises. I strongly advise potential travelers to consider alternative options and avoid the frustrations and disappointments that come with flying this airline.

18769,Southwest Airlines,3,"""again denied this ""freebie"" service""",15th May 2023,True,"  In 2007 Southwest served: 64.9 million cans of soda, juices, and water 11.3 million alcoholic beverages 6.1 million bags of pretzels 103.8 million bags of peanuts 14 million snackpacks 32 million other snacks Just think how much money Southwest would save if they stopped offering all those ""free"" drinks but then the public would go crazy.Â  Our beverage service has been canceled on probably 8 out of the last 10 flights I have been on.Â  And no I don't fly the same place so its not likely due to a specific route. But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.Â  An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).Â  On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they ""cancel"" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this ""freebie"" service in the name of supposed ""turbulence"" despite a relatively smooth flight.Â  I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like ""let me find out"".Â  Â A few minutes later, the captain came on and ""explained"" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.Â  When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me ""were not going to do that"" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would ""divert the plane""  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.Â  I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret. Although I dont know what they are so worried about.Â  Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience, let alone do anything that could actually make a difference (like report this on social media or via customer service). But still you dont have to ""hide"" and refuse to provide your name if you aren't doing anything wrong.Â  So this is all being done in the name of ""safety"" - lets go with that.

18770,Southwest Airlines,4,"""a cattle call boarding experience""",14th May 2023,False,"  Granted flights were delayed, so the SW terminal was packed. However, my flight was on time. Because of the droves of people around the woman calling out boarding information, I could not hear her. She used a tiny microphone which actually none of us could hear. She then chose to yell out information which no one could hear either. Being my first time flying SW, I unfortunately, hadnâ€™t researched how they board people. I had no idea where â€œCâ€ was and asked around to finally find where my boarding area was. There was a fellow â€œCâ€ woman who moved around, so I followed her. She said that since â€œA loaded, C could now line up.â€ It was then I figured out what the other number was on my ticket- so I lined up in that spot that was on a sign. As I got on the plane, I asked the flight attendant how I get a seat, â€œyou just chose anything open.â€ I had no idea. And I had checked my boarding pass and even â€œpre-boarded.â€ How did I miss this information? It truly was a cattle call boarding experience. Luckily there were some very nice people to help me along in the boarding process as to where to go. What a joke.

The gambling of your Vegas trip starts the moment you book a Southwest flight. Will you actually get there, or will they cancel your flight? Well, I am not lucky in cards - so my flight got cancelled just because. No inclement weather, no real reason. Just the fact that Southwest is incapable of doing their job of scheduling and has no care for their passengers time nor plans. So what they refunded the money? Thatâ€™s not what I was looking for - I was looking to see my friend and make memories. But their rebooking is just ridiculous. Delaying my weekend trip until Saturday night, no other options, no other compensation. They are professional at cancelling flights without a second thought and then basically insulting you with their rebooking.

I flew 11 May 2023 from BWI to Tulsa through St. Louis and I paid for Business Select so I could be in the first boarding group. When I checked in I was A01, which would mean I could get to my choice seat early and get my bag in an overhead bin. Yet there were 20 pre boarders on the first leg and 18 on the second leg - many who walked into the plane (only 5 wheel chairs total) The boarding process has become a joke as pre boarders, sit in the front 3-5 rows. So I think I'm going to request that every time I fly now because I pay $100 or so extra to get first choice of seat and overheard, yet that is no longer available because ALL pre borders have forced those who pay extra to sit in what's left. Sad thing is, many were able to walk to bathroom, get their luggage in and out of the overheads without issue.

Flight changes for our international flight now cost 5K and southwest says they are not responsible for flight delays and inability to get me to my destinations on time! I have never had such a negative overall experience during my travels that I had to take a moment just to air out the grievance at 4AM while still traveling.  A short hour flight became a 3-hour overall flight due to inclement weather and being re-routed to Grand Rapids Michigan. I understand that inclement weather cannot be controlled and safety is priority. One would assume as a purchaser of a connecting flight that when a portion of that flight is off schedule the airline will adjust as needed to still get the customer to their destination in a timely manner. I was not given any reasonable options as I was on my way to catch an international flight to Bali, Indonesia and had to be in LAX by 4AM, I was given a ticket to get into LAX at 9:30AM. Adjustments were made to get me flown to Seattle after waiting all night to get my bags in order to re-check them I was treated extremely poorly by the check-in bag personnel who was training another employee. She was very curt, abrasive, dry, and mean. When I brought it to her attention that I had been stuck awake in the airport all night and that I did not appreciate her demeanor she brushed it off and continued in a very aggressive energy to nitpick anything i said or did, such as placing both bags on the scale after the first one had been weighed. When I again emphasized the poor fashion in which she was treating me she said she ""refused to serve me any longer"" which to my knowledge is only acceptable in scenarios of disrespect and while i felt severely disrespected by her treatment of my person, I did not act in any disrespectful fashion toward her.

18781,Southwest Airlines,1,"""This is just awful""",30th April 2023,False,"  I had a horrible trip. I booked a trip from Oakland Ca. to Savannah Ga. in Nov. 2022. I HATE flying early, so I booked a flight that had a reasonable, late-morning departure and paid the extra money for a better schedule. About a week before my trip in April of 2023, Southwest canceled my flights and rebooked my whole trip. So, I had to get up at 3.30am to be at the airport by 4.30am for my new take-off time of 5.55am. Exactly what I didn't want and paid extra to avoid. There was no refund for my extra payment when they forced me onto the early undesirable schedule. Then.... On my return home from Savannah, our plane was delayed taking off at the Savannah airport. It turns out the fuel truck for our plane didn't have enough fuel in it. Seriously. So they went and got more fuel and then refuelled our plane which caused a delay to our connection in Houston. We would have had 9 minutes (given the delay for fuelling) to catch our flight in Houston, but Southwest elected to keep the plane to Oakland on time and leave us behind. Great. Now we are rebooked through Southwest for a flight the next day and we are in Houston overnight. And guess what? I have to get on a plane at 6.15am which is exactly why I paid extra money for my original schedule to avoid. The representative at the Houston airport was really nice (Angie G.) and we got a hotel voucher and a $200 Southwest voucher. But this just isn't enough. I'm arriving 16 hours late. I'm staying in a city overnight that I don't care to be in, and cutting my sleep for the second time in a week to keep a flight schedule that I didn't authorize or sign up for. I paid my pet sitter $200 to stay the night in my home and take care of my pets unexpectedly for the extra night. Where is the actual compensation for the 16 hours of my life that I spent overnight in Houston? I had to eat. I had to pay my pet sitter. I lost sleep and essentially, I lost an entire day of rest at home before my work week. This is just awful. I don't know what is going on with this airline, but I have no interest in your voucher to plan a trip with you ever.

And it is in my file too have one. SW ticket agent said wait and one will come to get me. After about 10 minutes I knew I wouldn't have enough time to get to my connecting flight. I found a wheelchair and walked pushing the wheelchair towards my connecting gate which was at the farthest end of the airport last gate. A SW employee saw that I was struggling and had me sit in the wheelchair and he took me the rest of the way to the gate. He wasn't called he just saw that I was having a hard time. I'm traveling again on the 3rd and I thought I should call and make sure wheelchair will be at my gate so I called customer service spoke with a lovely lady. I did not complain about what happened (no one for me there at the gate) but I thought I better call and make sure that doesn't happen again.

After they questioned him since they were there and seating is fcfs - he loudly announced in front of entire plane â€œitâ€™s because of her size itâ€™s a safety issueâ€. The entire plane laughed and talked about me the entire flight saying I should have been made to get off. I cried the entire flight home of embarrassment since my weight is due to a medical condition. SW promised me a LUV voucher for my â€œinconvenienceâ€ which was routed to the wrong email (not one on my complaint) and then refused to deal with me any further. I am advising please avoid SW if you are of size! When I flew American in the past, they were much more understanding and private in their interactions about my second seat purchase.

This was fine in Cancun but, when I was to board in Houston passengers who were taken off the plane were allowed to board prior to those of us who had paid for the priority boarding/seats and occupied the forward seats despite most not having paid for the seats. This also occurred when departing Nashville. The only difference being the passengers continuing on who came in on the flight were allowed to remain on the plane and improve their seats prior to our boarding. I was forced to more than halfway back in the plane. If these people are continuing on, they should board in the respective class with those boarding at the gate. Southwest is basically stealing the upgrade fee as their terrible policy of disregarding those have paid for early boarding despite those who improve their seats without paying for the privilege. In flight wifi/entertainment was not working and there are no charging ports or receptacles to charge devices. This was my first experience with the airline and I plan on it being the last. At least if I pay for Premium Economy or Business class I am able to receive my monies worth. The seats were very uncomfortable. That is enough, I think you get the point.

I traveled with a 10 week old puppy. I paid the fee $95. Which I was ok with until they said I had to check my bag because she counts as my carry on. If she counts as my carry on why is there a fee. Sheâ€™s not taking up any extra space. She weighs less than a normal carry on as well. I was told she had to be under the seat for take off and landing but on the plane the flight attendant was extremely rude. She told me she had to go back in her pet carrier. I explained what I was told and she continued to be extremely rude. I proceeded to put her back in her carrier under the seat, where she remained. The flight attendant came back to ask me my last name and then asked if I â€˜she was even a paid petâ€™. I proceeded to show her my receipt and the tag on the carrier. Stated if she was that concerned she should have checked when I boarded and not half way through the flight. I had my jacket on my lap and every time she passed by made me lift my jacket to show she wasnâ€™t on my lap. Which she never was - she remained in the carrier for the remainder of the flight. They have lost another customer due to very rude employees. If the rule is they have to stay in the carrier for the duration of the flight that should be clearly communicated when checking in. Also there is always a polite way to deal with customers but the employees continue to be unnecessarily rude. I will make sure to tell everyone that travels with pets my experience from now on.

18806,Southwest Airlines,1,"""Shame on you Southwest"" ",3rd February 2023,True,"Â What is going on with SW?? On a return flight from Puerto Rico to Denver, Southwest canceled the second leg of our flight out of Tampa, while we're in the air to Tampa, citing ""weather"". After doing much research and having our local news look into this, it appears that only the SW flights were canceled into Denver, other airlines were arriving as scheduled. The actual statistic for that evening were 47% of SW flights were cancelled into Denver and less than 5% of other airlines were cancelled. The FAA did not issue any closures or delays to Denver. I can't imagine why weather would be an excuse when no one else was using it. After talking to the agents, we kept being told that there were no other flights that evening, when in reality, there were. We just weren't offered those flights. And yes, there was availability according to the website. And they weren't canceled! We received some of the most unapologetic, uncaring, and disingenuous treatment from Southwest Airlines across the board. From the gate agent to the ticketing agent to the baggage agent to the customer service rep. After leaving the airport (because our flight was changed to a 5AM flight the following day), I called to inquire again if there were better flights, I had to wait ONE to TWO hours just to speak to a live person. Our options to return were an early morning flight or an evening flight for a non-stop flight. There was no way I was going to chance taking a flight with a layover anywhere, Southwest is not to be trusted and I didnâ€™t want to get into a situation where we were then stranded at yet another airport. I donâ€™t know what is going on with Southwest and why their business model is falling apart. SW used to be my â€œgo-toâ€ airline (we even had the credit card but have since retired it due to the airlineâ€™s inconsistency with flights). If SW thinks it's ok to strand passengers in random places just to make their â€œcustomary playbookâ€ profitable, then they are not focusing on what is important. The local news received a disingenuous reply from a SW rep regarding our situation but also showed some telling facts: ""Many of the flights we proactively canceled at the start of today were in anticipation of operational conditions in Denver."" Southwest cancelled our flight in the morning and we were not notified until we were in the air on our way to Tampa. If we had been notified we would have chosen to stay (at our own expense) in San Juan to spend more time with our family, but we were not given that option. Other airlines always lets us know when a flight is going to be delayed or cancelled and they do this in advance and they let us change our flight to a time that works for us. SW does not offer this. Their system is antiquated and not user-friendly. We are disgusted with the treatment we received. They are losing loyal customers left and right. Why do they keep treating your passengers this way?

18807,Southwest Airlines,1,"""reacted rudely and aggressively""",1st February 2023,True," I had SWA tickets from ONT to ATL with a connection in Dallas. Southwest clearly lost control of their operation on 1/30-31 and stranded me in Vegas. Ok, there was ice in Dallas, but I would have been happy to keep my hotel room and car another day to avoid being stranded. They kept telling me to come to the airport as they had rescheduled my flight. Instead they cancelled my flight FIVE times and promised me each time that I could reach my destination on time. I asked if there was any chance of missing my connection and SW said no. I think they were fabricating stories because they got me to give up my hotel room, rental car. One time in ONT they pushed off from the gate and rode around on the runway and then parked right back at the gate. It was hot in the plane and full of fumes. I got sick on the plane. Once parked again I got off the plane and tried to talk to some one, ANYONE, who could help but there was just one ticket person and a long line of angry customers. I never was able to schedule another connection in Ontario. At one point they said they would take my luggage off the plane and then said they wouldnt. So I got back on the plane prefering to be stranded with luggage rather than without. These Southwest people are rude and crude and have no idea what they are telling people! Why do they feel they have to tell people things that aren't true? Is it just some power trip and they enjoy wrecking the plans of their customers? Anyhow, I eventually landed in Vegas and once again there was no one who knew what was going on. No one could tell me how to get home to Atlanta. I had a boarding pass for the flight to Atlanta but when I tried to use it they said the boarding pass was no good. Some SWA jerk grabbed it out of my hands and said ""Hmm, it says it's for Atlanta"". Anyhow, they told me to go talk to customer service so I lost my seating assignment. At ""customer service"" they printed out another ticket and said to go get on the plane. I tried and again the boarding pass was not working. The whole time they were acting as if this was my fault, even though it was their obvious flawed way of doing things. Any airline this bad should not be allowed to fly. They are completely unsympathetic. Just rude and nasty if you express simple concerns about your schedule or luggage. In one breath they blame it on flight control, tell you what flight to get on, and then it all turns out to be bogus information. Keep in mind that Southwest perpetuated this mess over three days. Maybe somewhere someone was working on it but you could have fooled me. They looked like idiots and no one had any confidence in what they were saying. Southwest made a lot of people desperate for no reason. Ok, there was ice in Dallas but Southwest made the situation 10 times worse by telling people their flights were still taking off and convincing people to come to the airport. This made some people a bit panicky for no reason other than a few airline people wanting to look like they had all the answers.

18811,Southwest Airlines,6,"""eye-opening and frustrating""",21st January 2023,True,"  My wife and I have been traveling on Southwest for nearly three decades and generally appreciate their service or that they do their best to be helpful when travel plans go sideways. In fact we just had a trip through Southwest Vacations that was fantastic. Our latest experience with them, however, has been both eye-opening and frustrating. We had booked flights for February 2nd from Puerto Vallarta to Reno with a connection in Phoenix. We had flight 1299 from Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix and then flight 547 from Phoenix to Reno. We received an email from Southwest notifying us that our flights were changed from Puerto Vallarta to Denver and then Denver to Reno. We had seen this Denver connection when we were initially booking our trip however we did not want to fly from Mexico to Denver in the dead of the winter. Too much of a chance of being stuck in Mexico. I went on the Southwest website and could see that our original flights through Phoenix and on to Reno were still there and they were still selling tickets for these flights. I called Southwest customer service and asked that our flights be changed back to our original flights. The customer service representative changed us back to the original 1299 flight Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix but informed us (hereâ€™s where things got wonky) that we could no longer choose our original Phoenix to Reno flight 547 because the two flights were no longer â€˜linkedâ€™ in their system. I asked her what she meant by that. Apparently, Southwest links certain flights together so when you search for a flight from A to B with a connection in between it will only show you these â€˜linkedâ€™ flights. There may be other connecting flights that are departing earlier or later depending on your needs but you will not see them because they are not linked flights in their system. So our original flights were â€˜linkedâ€™ when we booked them but were then â€˜unlinkedâ€™ and changed by Southwest to Denver. And when I tried to change them back I was told that is no longer an option because those two flights are no longer linked. The only â€˜linkedâ€™ flight through Phoenix was a 5-hour and 20 minute layover in Phoenix and then a flight stopping in Vegas and traveling on to Reno. I pointed out to Southwest that there was an earlier flight 867 through Vegas and on to Reno with only a 2 hour and 10 minute layover. I was told that was not an option because that was not a â€˜linkedâ€™ flight. Seriously! You changed our flights! You un-linked our original flights and refuse to do anything to restore our original flights or alleviate the lengthy delay you left us with. Câ€™mon Southwest you can do better. At the end of most flights the flight attendant will say ""We know you have a choice in flying and we thank you for flying Southwest."" And so my wife and I will spend our 5 hour and 20 minute layover contemplating our future travel plans and considering if it's time to exercise that choice.

Our Flight was delayed multiple times, during that time I was able to do some research as to what was going on. Due to severe storm activity across the country many airlines had to cancel flights. Southwest included. I understand people being upset, but what I appreciate is Southwests ongoing communication to let their passengers know ahead of time that the Airline and Flights were experiencing ""Irregular Operations"", they clearly assure their passengers ahead of time: ""If your flight was canceled and you would like a refund, please submit a request"". So I went fully knowing my flight could be cancelled. Of course multiple delays, the ground crew communicated with us multiple times, telling us they were doing what they could, that something had happened to their network. could have it been hacked? or challenges with having to cancel flights due to storm activity? Regardless, this airline wouldn't have cancelled if they felt the airways were safe, or they had the capacity.

We waited hours in line to rebook the next flight tomorrow. Tomorrow comes, same thing happens. They delay our flight 3x once again. After that, I knew they were bound to cancel at the last minute once again. So, I left to go home without even rebooking. I checked my email and ""surprise"", they cancelled it last minute before boarding. I feel bad for the passengers who had hope and stayed waiting all night. Thanks Southwest for ruining my family's Christmas and thousands of other's as well. I guess if I want to visit my family on holidays, I'll remember to never book Southwest. Truly unacceptable and unforgivable. I'm 100% paying more to fly Delta now. Learned my lesson. I forgot to mention they sent all our luggage without us.

18829,Southwest Airlines,1,"""I went home bagless & exhausted""",27th December 2022,True,"  On Saturday 12/24 I was at the airport by 10:15 for my 12:15 boarding of Flt 2909 to Manchester. I'm always early. It was delayed to 1:45 then cancelled by 11:30. Got on line, no flights to Manchester so I booked one to Boston that stopped in Tennessee first, I think that was Flt 3223 scheduled for 5:45 PM & landing after midnight. I took it. I will pay the $200 + for car service to get to New Hampshire. I went downstairs got my bags from the Manchester flt & checked them for the Boston Flight. Went through security again. At 3:30 that flight cancelled. They told me I could rebook for Monday morning flt 3159 several stops but you stay on the plane to Boston get in 6 hours later. I booked it. I was told my bags would be downstairs again. I went downstairs was told over & over again by the staff downstairs my bags would be down as soon as they could. 8 hours later when the baggage doors closed I was told no more bags coming down I could speak to a manager but there were no managers downstairs, I could go upstairs. I did & guess what, no manager there either. I went home bagless & exhausted. I asked at least ten time & was told the bags will be here. There was no real security watching these bags I had the Christmas gifts for my family in one bag & all my winter clothes in the other. I would have left, if I felt they would be secure. I wish I had. I stayed home Christmas my 3rd flt was cancelled. I tried calling Southwest on hold the first time 3 hours had to hang up & then 4 hours on hold & then disconnected. I went back to the airport on 12/26. Got on line 7:15AM to try again, to get a flt. to Manchester. I was on that line for 4.5 hours. The reason it was so long is that we were not important to Southwest They had 3- sometimes 4 employees at the counter & 3 & sometime all 4 of the Southwest employees would take the A list people that just walked into there lane, that haven't waited more then 5 minutes. So basically the group of over 150 to over 200 people were left with sometimes, one person, who was at the end of the counter, to assist them in finding a new flight. How disgusting! How belittling to treat your customers with such disrespect. I finally rebooked & now for the last time I'm going to try to get to Manchester on 12/28. Now, I go downstairs to get my luggage, you know it, not happening. Its no where to be found, so what are my options a line, 2 hours later, I get into the luggage counter and ask, where is my luggage? My last flight was flight cancelled yesterday? Well the young man says, one bag in is Boston & one is still in Tampa. I didn't go to Boston but my bag got a spot? I told him the other bag is not here I looked for it several times. He said well it could be on a cart somewhere & we don't have the staff to look for it. You had the staff to send one of them to Boston? Was it an A list bag? I asked how do I get my bags? He said once you land in Manchester you can request your bags. What? Now you want me to get in line in another state? I know that Boston doesn't fly to Manchester? So what you're telling me, is they will fly my bags somewhere else & then to Manchester? Do I get the mileage points or do my bags get them? Also by the time my bags get to Manchester, if, in fact, they do find them, I will either be in NY or back in Tampa. The only warm clothes I own are in one of those bags.

18935,Spirit Airlines,1,"""What a disgusting experience""",25th July 2023,True,"  Planned a three day trip to Vegas. Flew Spirit out of Detroit. The flight was delayed 9+ hours. Boarding should have occurred on or about 9:20 pm on June 1 with a take off of 10:02 pm. The flight took off at 6:20 am the following morning June 2. The gate agents provided very little information during the delay other than they were waiting on a pilot to come in off another flight. During the wait time, the pilot that did show up ""timed out"". Eventually the staff announced the flight would not leave until 5:15 am the next morning. Frustrated customers were given the choice for refund or to book on another Spirit Flight. Customers were so angry with the gate agents and Spirit for the delays, lack of communication and overall attitude that local police were brought to the gate to supervise Spirit's shenanigans. Vendors close early at Detroit Airport. For those of us that could not rebook a flight, no food vouchers were offered, no hotel vouchers offered and if you wanted to rebook a flight, only Sprit was offered (no other Airlines) forcing Spirt customers additional days of delays. When it came time fly out the following morning, a pilot was late causing a flight attendant to time out. In 9+ hours, Spirit couldn't get their stuff together even leave close to on time the next morning. Tried to resolve with customer service. No response from Spirit's CEO, and Spirit's customer service agent was useless. Do not fly this airline! They do not deserve you! During the process of dealing with customer service, I had booked a flight with Spirit in September for which I asked them to cancel and refund. Even with all the issues, they would only provide a credit for the flight and charged a $69 cancellation fee. I advised them to donate my credit to charity. I will not fly Spirit again.

The staff was SO incredibly rude. From check in to boarding, the customer service was abysmal. Our reservation had a carry on and checked bag. At check in, the attendants were determined to make our lives hell. We spent $90 per bag to check in. The attendant told us we could have saved money if we vacuum sealed our clothes inside our bags, and she plans to make a TikTok of tips and tricks to save money on spirit.  Then the same attendants were at boarding. They made me zone 1 and my friendâ€™s ticket zone 4, after we spent $180 to bring our bags with us, and checked in together on the same reservation. We didnâ€™t realize this when we started to board. They allowed some people on one reservation board together, but not us! They pulled my friend out of the line then told her she would need to spend $100 more if she didnâ€™t put her wristlet inside her carry on. While that happened, they told me I wasnâ€™t allowed to wait for her. You think youâ€™re getting a deal. Some info they donâ€™t tell you- a checked bag is 40 lbs, not the usual 50.

So, on 7/12/2023, one of us used the spirit app to check the terms and payment deduction detail of cancellation because we want to decide whether to cancel or change or just keep it in order protect my benefits. In the app, she clicked the button ""modify my trip"", i.e., cancel or change my trip. It then led her to the cancel button. But she didn't expect after clicking this, the app switched to the website and after uploading a while it cancelled my flights directly and automatically without providing us with the terms and results and the payment detail. Then it led her back to my app, our trip information is all gone. And after the system cancelled our reservation without getting our permission, later the spirit sent an email to Jingyao Li who paid the tickets with a form of money deduction detail and a 10-dollar voucher. How dare they to do this without mentioning us about the fee detail and results in the app and when it switched to the cancellation processing on the website. We have spent 394.54 dollars, but in the end, we are forced to be given a 10-dollar voucher for future Spirit trip. If we were informed that we cannot get refund and the payment detail of cancellation when clicking the button in the app, we would have not used to app to click it. The Spirit company has the obligation to notice the customers about the fee detail and terms agreement option when they click cancel button to let them know the detail not just cancelling directly and automatically without customer's permission. Besides, there are three of us. The app didn't provide us with the chance to decide whether to keep it or more changes but directly switched to the website and cancelled all of our reservation. It was crazy and unbelievable. we tried hard immediately to contact with the staff, but they said the website showed flights were cancelled and they can do nothing for us. So, what's the point of asking the staff for help if everything the company relies on is the non-customer friendly website and tricky app. Due to their refusal of any help about our case, we have to rebook and reschedule our trip. Our request is that Spirit gives us full refunds of this payment fee $394.54. We were very disappointed because we got nothing, no flights, no service and no help.

Flight NK2086 from Boston to Orlando was delayed by about 2 hours, and although we asked ground staff and stewards on the plane to communicate with the plane in Orlando so they could wait for us, they ignored our requests. When we landed in Orlando and got out of the plane (after it was delayed another 20 or so minutes because the gate was occupied), I heard an announcement that boarding would close for the SDQ flight in 1 minute. I sprinted to the next gate followed by at least 8 others trying to make our connection, only to find the ground staff at the gate to close the door as we arrived. We were then told to go to the counter to rebook our flight. It was at least a 1hr wait in line because there were so many stranded Spirit passengers from various flights, and by the time it was our turn, the alternative flight we had seen online was already full. The staff told the 4 of us we were already rebooked for the same flight the next day, meaning a 24 hour wait. Since we didn't have that time and didn't want to be stuck at the airport for 24 hours, we asked to be refunded for the missed flight and our bag fees. I asked if they would cover our hotel (and potentially meals) since we would have to stay overnight at the airport (especially if we would have gone with the offered alternative of waiting 24 hrs). They said no, I asked if we should sleep on the ground and they said yes. We ended up booking a flight with a different carrier that left early morning, still forcing us to spend the night at the airport and no sleep. Plus losing a night at the AirBnB that I paid for in Santo Domingo. Besides this horrible customer service and no compensation for the whole situation, on the way back it got worse. One of my 3 friends already planned to go back to Boston on Tuesday June 27 instead of Thursday June 29, but with the same flights. When he arrived at the airport, he found that the staff had canceled the entire rest of the reservation instead of just the one leg of flight we missed. Even though he had his flights in the Spirit app in his itinerary the entire time up to when he got to the airport. So he ended up being stuck at the airport for another night and having to book at his own expense another flight (very expensive last minute), and it took him a total of 2,5 days to make it back to Boston. The rest of us didn't want to be in this situation and ended up booking another flight since we didn't trust the app, because it had still shown the reservation for him as well. When confronting Spirit about all of this mess and the extra costs incurred, they took zero accountability for the lack of communication between flights. They refunded a small amount for the missed flight on the way there and gave some travel credit (why would I ever fly with them again), but not for bags ($100 each way!), or any of the expenses incurred with booking new flights, missed time and food/lodging.

Discourteous in not serving a cup of water: Before boarding, I asked air hostess a cup of water as i wanted to take medicines myself being a senior citizen. She told that flight would take off. No issue. Bur after flight take off, no response from the air hostess. However the male crew was bringing ordered food. Then i told him which was after half an hour take off. Then he arranged cup of water through air hostess. By travelling in Spirit Airlines, even the basic need for water in a cup is denied. . Even after paying 30 dollars for checked in luggage, we were asked to carry the luggage despite our difficulty in carrying it. What is the purpose of collecting baggage charges. Does Spirit airlines has a motive to harass the customers. It is not the cheapest fare alone matters, a minimum travel comfort and courtesy is expected.

18953,Spirit Airlines,1,"""Do not fly this airline""",10th July 2023,True,"  Planned a three day trip to Vegas. Flew Spirit out of Detroit. The flight was delayed 9+ hours. Boarding should have occurred on or about 9:20 pm on June 1 with a take off of 10:02 pm. The flight took off at 6:20 am the following morning June 2. The gate agents provided very little information during the delay other than they were waiting on a pilot to come in off another flight. During the wait time, the pilot that did show up ""timed out"". Eventually the staff announced the flight would not leave until 5:15 am the next morning. Frustrated customers were given the choice for refund or to book on another Spirit Flight. Customers were so angry with the gate agents and Spirit for the delays, lack of communication and overall attitude that local police were brought to the gate to supervise Spirit's shenanigans. Vendors close early at Detroit Airport. For those of us that could not rebook a flight, no food vouchers were offered, no hotel vouchers offered and if you wanted to rebook a flight, only Sprit was offered (no other Airlines) forcing Spirt customers additional days of delays. When it came time fly out the following morning, a pilot was late causing a flight attendant to time out. In 9+ hours, Spirit couldn't get their stuff together even leave close to on time the next morning. Tried to resolve with customer service. No response from Spirit's CEO, and Spirit's customer service agent was useless. Do not fly this airline! They do not deserve you! During the process of dealing with customer service, I had booked a flight with Spirit in September for which I asked them to cancel and refund. Even with all the issues, they would only provide a credit for the flight. I advised them to donate my credit to charity. I will not fly Spirit again.

I was so grateful, I would have had to spend the night in the Atlanta airport, it is after midnight at this time. Last shuttle pick up is 12:00 midnight. My daughter drove from Augusta to meet me about an hour away where they dropped me off. So the shuttle service doesn't give a refund, only a credit to be used within the year.

18957,Spirit Airlines,1,"""spent the entire night awake at Airport""",9th July 2023,False,"  My daughter purchased round-trip tickets several weeks before traveling from Newark Airport to Phoenix with Spirit airlines with her two cats. The plane left over 21 minutes earlier than scheduled. She was given replacement tickets, but leaving from Atlantic City instead. She spent the entire night awake at Airport with cats. In a.m. she spent $168.03 on Uber to travel to Atlantic city Airport. When arriving in Phoenix (she had change in Orlando fla.), her 1 piece of luggage that she paid $110 for was lost. She lost the 2 hour ride from my friend because of schedule change. The shuttle doesn't allow cats. She paid another 2 hour Uber ride of $153.56 to get to my home. On her return date, 8 days later, she still hadn't received luggage even though they found it 3 days prior. She requested a refund or re-schedule for return flight (without cats) because she refused to travel without receiving her luggage first. It was refused unless she paid a fee costing MORE than the ticket. The luggage arrived 1 hour 50 minutes prior to departure and I live 2 hours away. They labeled her a ""no-show"", but it was her luggage that was the ""no-show"". She now lost her return ride and incurred a shuttle cost of $50. She had to purchase return ticket with Frontier plus baggage cost. There were many other unnecessary costs due to lost luggage, one example being that she had to pay out of pocket for virtual Dr. visit for emergency script of meds that she was becoming ill to be without. Her Spirit tickets cost $591.36, Uber $321.59, Shuttle $50 etc., etc., etc. Needless to say, she has been ill, overwhelmed, disoriented without clothing changes, meds, and many many other hurdles caused by Spirit. She was traveling to AZ to prep food, horâ€™dourves, transport necessities and set up at a location for my recently deceased sonâ€™s Memorial. I was too ill and was depending on her help.

They werenâ€™t letting him into the flight and said he needed to pay $90 to make it a â€œcarry-onâ€. He went to speak to a manager, and after taking their time and delaying the flight for 45 mins, they expedited the process and quickly shut the doors, and left him behind.

They never issued a credit but was told they was a possibility to help because of the death of a family member and I could forgo the chat feature in the App. Yes, I was speaking with someone that told me to text someone else through the app. Thatâ€™s what I call great customer service. So, I did. During the text chat I explained the death of my family member and they gave their condolences and ask me to send over either a link to the Obituary, the actual Obituary, a death certificate or a doctorâ€™s note. The one I sent was the link to the obituary since the others would take time. It took all of 30 seconds to tell me that I did not meet the policy. I didnâ€™t understand and I asked what did the mean? They said that I bought the ticket after he had died and I explained that I had not yet received word that my family member had died and I was out of the country when I made the reservation and got the word the following morning. Needless to say I didnâ€™t have the patience to text back and forth and explain myself and I asked again can I just receive a credit, iâ€™m not trying to get away with anything, I just want to go to a funeral. So, instead of wasting the dollars that I had spent to go to waste. I decided to fly through MCO and fly to my final destination, where the funeral was. I confirmed my flight and checked in and headed to the airport while reading what I can take onboard with me as a personal item. I have a over night carry on briefcase. On the website it strictly dictates backpack, briefcase, purses, etc; as I walk into the area at the FLL security checkpoint. I am stopped and asked to fit my bag in a make shift square which fit but the wheels prevented the bag going clean through meanwhile there were backpacks people were carrying twice the size of my briefcase. I really donâ€™t get this policy if you cannot enforce all sizes of back fitting in that same square. I paid the $89 bag fee to fly onto my next connecting flight to my final destination to make it to the funeral which really is tomorrow but again because Spirit Airlines has no soul and a terrible policy in the event of a family members death.

Iâ€™ve worked in the Airline industry before actually as a Transportation manager for a catering company that actually serviced Spirit Airlines out of LAX. This was my 1st time actually flying on Spirit and I had my reservations about doing so, just based on the reputation but I placed my faith in believing my experience would be different. Yesterday I arrive at LAX for my flight to San Juan Puerto Rico about 2 hours prior to departure. I head to kiosk to print my boarding passes, and when I put in my confirmation #. I received a message that Iâ€™m checking in too early and my flight is scheduled to leave tomorrow - please see an agent. So then I must stand in this line to get to an agent for over an hour. I learned my connecting flight to Detroit was cancelled. When I finally got the counter the agent told me that my next flight out is in 2 days. My trip was from Monday to Friday now this issue has caused me to lose 3 days out of my trip and if I flew out Wednesday night I basically would turn right back around. I was looking forward to this 1st time trip to Puerto Rico but it looks like that has been delayed. The only options I had was to take the flight change or refund. Obviously I had to do the refund as I was losing on my reserved hotel room that I had for this 2 days, and honestly there was no way I was going to go through the nightmare of getting home. I cut my loses and then proceeded with a refund. As much as I had planned and anticipated the trip all the joy was lost. At the time Iâ€™m writing this I should have already landed and been taking in the island but since my vacation was canceled I returned back to work for a vacation I had planned for months.

19006,Spirit Airlines,1,"""the entire experience left much to be desired""",5th June 2023,False,"  Disappointing Experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com. I recently booked a flight for my sound engineer on Spirit Airlines through Expedia.com, and unfortunately, the entire experience left much to be desired. I had planned a trip from San Antonio, Texas to Norfolk over the weekend, which involved four flights due to layovers. However, my disappointment began when Spirit Airlines abruptly canceled the trip on the day of departure at 5:30 am, citing a lack of staff. This lack of preparedness and consideration for their customers time and plans was extremely frustrating. One would expect that in such circumstances, the airline would provide a refund or alternative arrangements for affected passengers. Unfortunately, this was not the case for my return trip. Despite the cancellation being caused by Spirit Airlines, they refused to issue a refund. This kind of inflexibility and lack of accountability is certainly disappointing, especially during these trying times where every penny counts. One of the reasons I had chosen Spirit Airlines was its reputation for affordable fares, but the overall experience has made me question whether the potential savings are worth the frustration and inconvenience. Moreover, the lack of customer support and understanding from the airline only exacerbates the negative experience. Additionally, I want to express my dissatisfaction with Expedia.com, the platform through which I made the booking. While I understand that they act as a middleman between customers and airlines, I expected better assistance and support in such a situation. It would have been helpful if they had intervened on my behalf to secure a refund or explore alternative options. In conclusion, my experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com was highly disappointing. The last-minute cancellation by Spirit Airlines due to staff shortages, coupled with their refusal to provide a refund for the return trip, demonstrates a lack of responsibility and customer-centric approach. I would caution others against booking flights with Spirit Airlines, and I hope that Expedia.com can improve their customer support and advocacy for their users in such situations.",,Business,Premium Economy,"San Antonio, TX to Norfolk, VA",2023-06-01,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no,NK

After multiple gate and time changes, my return flight was cancelled at 2a. I stood in line for 2 plus hours with other people from a total of four cancelled flights. By 430a, I was rebooked on the earliest flight available, the red eye that night. I spent money on a Lyft back to the area of the city that I was familiar with, and was lucky enough by 8a to connect with a friend who let me charge my phone and laptop at their office so I could book a place to shower and nap. If my time itself is not included, I lost $350 on an AirBnB, Lyft rides and meals. If you value my time spent on this endeavor, and I do, add on another $240. Altogether taking a chance on Spirit Airlines cost me an extra $437 (paid for non-existent wifi access on return flight, bike return, extra meals, place to stay and cab/Lyft rides) out of pocket and another minimum $240 in opportunity costs. So not only did I not save money, I spent way more on this Spirit Airlines trip than booking my trip on American Airlines would have cost me. On a positive note, I interacted with over a dozen polite, cheerful and helpful employees of the airline.

19018,Spirit Airlines,1,"""I will never fly Spirit again""",2nd June 2023,True,"  I have never in my life been treated so poorly by an airline. We were supposed to leave Austin by 5:50am and arrive to NYC by 2:30pm. We were stuck in Austin for 5 hours before our flight took off. And then we missed our layover. They rebooked us to a flight that wouldnâ€™t get us to NYC until 1:30am almost 12 hours later than our original booking. Which means the hotel we paid for already, that we would not be able to use today, would be money wasted. Iâ€™m explaining how inconveniencing to our travel, time and finances their mistakes were today we were told that all they could do is give us two $50 vouchers that expire in August. Why after a day of being told that my time, money and travel didnâ€™t matter to them would I want to fly with them again. I tried to at least get my money back for the flights to cover the hotel cost we lost out on and they refused. Then I get my boarding passes and our seats arenâ€™t together. Mind you, the two people in front of me asked if they could be moved to sit together and they were accommodated immediately. When explaining, kindly, what sort of day weâ€™ve had due to spirit and asking if I could please sit with my husband and they refused to do it. After explaining that they just did it for the people in front of me, I was rudely denied with attitude and threatened to get kicked off of the plane and put on the next flight. I am so exhausted with dealing with such an unaccommodating and rude airline. Because of Spirit Airlines our very much needed getaway has started out so poorly and I have not felt cared for at all. I will never fly Spirit again and am just so sad with how I have been treated today. I am trying so hard to not let it ruin our trip.

Iâ€™ve flown to Vegas on Spirit twice, the 1st time wasnâ€™t too bad, on time, seats a little cramped but itâ€™s a short flight, baggage did take over an hour to arrive, mean while my driver outside waiting & driving around & around. Everyone laughs or says good luck when I said I was flying Spirit. Baggage weight is lowered to 40 lbs, not typical 50 of other airlines, & $14.00 more for initial bag than say like Delta. They charge you $70.00 for your carry on,  my purse was free, my make up bag around 12 X 9 X 5 inches it was an additional $99.00! It wouldâ€™ve fit under the seat in front of me with my purse. My flight from SLC to Vegas was $208.89 for a grand total of $37789. I did upgrade my seat and purchased Wi-Fi for grand total of 429.88 (I booked round trip my flight home on Delta was $128.90). So hereâ€™s my 2 cents to try and make someone elseâ€™s flight better Spirit! Train your customer service with suggestions & pleasantries instead of condescending attitude. Not a single employee was willing to help or find a way to help facilitate any issues. Stop nickel & dimeing, & hidden fees. The baggage fees are ridiculous.

I planned a one day trip to golf with business partners of mine, Spirit never even bothered to load my golf bag onto the plane. I was not given a reason as to why my only checked bag was not loaded. When I expressed my anger with their rep, he called the police on me. I had to cancel my tee time and was not given a refund (had to prepay for the holiday). Upon arriving to the airport to retrieve my bag they had flown overnight, and to check in for my return flight, I was told there was an unknown error while checking me in. I was not given a reason for the error, and the only option they gave me was to refund my return flight and that I should check with other airlines about getting a flight home as there was nothing else they could or would do for me.

She did not allow me to proceed and forced me to do it. I had to get everything out from my backpack as my passport, driver license and the phone with the App with boarding pass was inside. That is the way you treat people? I assume because the lady though I was stupid or ignorant as she talking to me in Spanish.

19026,Spirit Airlines,1,"""Avoid them at all costs""",28th May 2023,True,"  I am a vibrant 78 year old woman and I have travelled internationally for most of my life so I am not easily intimidated by the challenges that air travel can involve. That said, I have never experienced a worse airline anywhere in the world and I strongly recommend that you pay whatever the cost to travel by any other airline but Spirit. I chose them to travel to Virginia from Texas because the flight times were convenient and my outgoing flights worked just as planned. My return flight experience was a total nightmare. The hub for Spirit is Ft. Lauderdale Fl. When I checked my luggage in Richmond, My bag was one pound over the 40 lb. limit and the Spirit representative told me i would have to remove and carry items to reduce the weight or pay for a second bag. That was only the beginning but it was the least of my problems. We flew to Ft. Lauderdale for my connecting flight to Austin, and right up to departure time the monitor at the gate said the flight was on time. At the time the flight was supposed to be boarding I asked the representative at the gate if I had missed an announcement of a delay and she said the flight was cancelled. There was nothing on the monitor to indicate the flight was not leaving. She was rude and unhelpful when I asked if there were later flights. I found a customer service desk for Spirit and the two women reps were chatting and ignored me for several minutes. When one of them checked on flights to Austin, she said my best option was to fly to Baltimore and connect to Austin there, getting me home at midnight instead of 6 pm. So I waited for 5 hours to fly to Baltimore and when I got there I found that the flight to Austin was not the same day. I had to spend the night. In Baltimore i asked a Spirit rep if they could recommend a hotel and she was rude and said I should have arranged that in Ft. Lauderdale. By this time it was midnight since the plane was late leaving Ft. Lauderdale. A woman in baggage claim helped me identify a hotel and I spent $20 on a cab and $140 on a hotel. The next morning I flew to Austin and of course my luggage was lost. So by the time I got home, without my luggage I had been traveling for 26 hours for the flight that was supposed to take 5 hours with a layover. The Spirit employees main goal is to get you out of their face. I thought it was due to poor training, but I soon realized that they already know the system doesn't work to help their passengers so they don't even try. They just cop an attitude and tell you your out of luck. And if you call on the phone, the call center is somewhere where no-one speaks English. Not a coincidence. It is part of the system. This trip was the most expensive I have ever incurred flying to Richmond where my daughter lives. In the end for the cost of the tickets, the baggage fees, the seat fees and the hotel and cab fare, I spent more than $800. I could have flown 1st class on any other carrier for less. The stress and exhaustion of traveling for 26 hours and being treated horribly by every Spirit employee is something I can't describe other than as my worst nightmare. The Department of Transportation needs to do something to end the abusive practices of Spirit Airlines. They claim to be an economical airline but in fact they are a bait and switch business.

For a single flight from Nashville to Philadelphia we were delayed for 8 hours, got on the plane, were told by the crew that the flight was cancelled because they were late and couldn't get additional hours approved. Went to Spirit desk to get rebooked along with the rest of the plane and was told they wouldn't cover a hotel or any food (which is illegal) and then lied and said the reason they couldn't take off was weather related so they wouldn't be obligated to pay as that's ""an Act of God"" so we had to get our own food, Ubers and hotel which cost even more before going to our next flight they gave us (a worse flight too, no longer direct) with no reimbursement in any fashion. We even missed work because of this. That flight is also delayed in Orlando which resulted us not getting home until 3 in the morning with work the next day. There was even a fight at the gate which Spirit employees did nothing about! Don't even try to contact they're customer service either, they were all rude and unhelpful of they answered at all.

21317,United Airlines,1,"""wouldn't conceive flying Polaris again""",21st July 2023,False," Polaris class SFO-PPT and back. Never again. First, check-in for Polaris at SFO was surreal, with 50+ people on line and only one agent actively checking Polaris-class passengers in. I found myself longing for the business-class check-in desks at the other, non-U.S. carriers in the International Terminal, carriers that actually seem to offer a premium service to people who have paid for it. I arrived at the terminal two hours before my United flight but got only 20 minutes in the lounge as a result of this mess. Second, United's boarding process is a slap in the face to passengers who pay upwards of $7000 for a seat in Polaris. If you're not a member of one of their frequent-flyer levels, you're forced to board with economy-class passengers. Every other airline in existence lets passengers in the premium cabin board first, before the coach stampede starts with people pushing and shoving to board so they can get first claim to overhead space. This is one reason why I will never fly United again. Third, my berth in Polaris was filthy, with lint and crumbs littering the air vent along the bulkhead. Fourth, the food in Polaris was virtually inedible. Again, when you're paying upwards of $7000 for a ticket, you expect something that isn't going to make you gag. Unfortunately, United is the only airline apart from budget carrier French Bee that flies from SFO to Tahiti nonstop. For any other international route where there's competition, however, I wouldn't conceive of ever flying United Polaris again.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Papeete,2023-07-01,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,no,UA

Was stranded in Italy with my daughter because of an error on the first leg of the trip using Lufthansa. The UA booking agent wrote my daughters name incorrectly for that leg of the trip (which had a different confirmation number), so we were unable to return. When I called long distance from Italy to try to get another flight (there is no UA office at the airport), the customer service rep didnâ€™t fix the error, didnâ€™t book us a new flight since we missed the first one by trying to get the name corrected, and hung up on me. This left us stranded in a foreign country with NO ticket home as a result of their error. I called back again and finally got tickets back to a different airport and my daughter and I had to find our own way back from New Jersey to CT, taking four different trains with our large suitcases in tow. Iâ€™m completely dissatisfied with this airline and the whole customer service experience.

As it was a retrofitted 777 with proper Premium Plus seats, it was not bad. LAX is certainly not the best airport, as the boarding area was tiny, thus very crowded. The Premium Plus seat was comfortable. We had the first row with huge legroom, more like 55-in rather than the normal 38-in pitch. In-flight meals were fine, and they served a full meal plus a light meal (by choice). That was quite good for a 4.5 hour domestic flight in premium economy.

The flight departed on time and arrived early. The 787-10 was the highlight.

We ran all across the airport to board the plane and that was the one that departed on time?! They couldn't delay that one two minutes to make up for their error?

21323,United Airlines,1,"""will not be flying United ever again""",18th July 2023,False," I do not usually write reviews, but this was the most horrific flying experience I have ever had in my life. I get to the Jacksonville airport at 5:00 am for a 6:30 flight. At the boarding and luggage check booth, where there were nearly 100 people waiting, there was one attendant on duty - it took a solid hour just to print my boarding pass and check my luggage. All other airlines had several attendants working. After sprinting to my gate, I found out that the flight had been delayed for 3 full hours. When we finally boarded, I got a message saying that my connecting flight to Rochester had been cancelled. After standing not one, but two customer service lines, I was able to book a flight to Syracuse. Originally leaving at 9:30, the flight was again delayed by an hour. We landed at 12:00 am, but taxied for another 40 minutes because the airline had sent an unscheduled flight to our departure gate for cleaning. Never in my life have I experienced this level of negligence at an airline. On transferring to Syracuse I asked the customer service representative if I had to re-check my baggage. She told me ""no"", and that I was ""in the system"". I asked the concierge at the gate for Syracuse the same thing - he said ""no"". After deplaning, I discovered that my luggage had been left in Newark. It is now 11:00 pm the next day, and the luggage has just now been delivered to my hotel.

I had a toddler with me who was supposed to sit on my lap. We were traveling with my spouse and the kiosk wouldnâ€™t allow check in. We came in two hours before our flight and got tossed around. We were advised to see a kiosk with an attendant on it waited 30 minutes and we still couldnâ€™t get checked in. At this point we had a little under an hour to get everything done yet no one knows how to get my boarding pass printed with my lap baby. My husband was able to board but I missed my flight. They told me to wait on a line that took over 2.5 hours to get to a rep and that as far as they are concerned I missed my flight even though there was still time. I had two employees bicker in front of my family because the employee asked another employee to assist and she didnâ€™t like that we were thrown on her. After I waited for 2.5 hours to get this situation rectified the rep told me there was nothing he can do because the confirmation was split once my husband got his pass and I essentially lost my reservation and had to wait 1.5 hours to get ahold of a reservation specialist on the phone. FYI they donâ€™t have reservation specialists in the airport. United employees doesnâ€™t take responsibility or try to correct the situation. I was left to make other plans with another airline company as being stranded in an airport with a toddler wasnâ€™t going to work. I went to JetBlue and they had zero issues with processing my lap babyâ€™s pass. United doesnâ€™t care about their customers, if they had it there way I would have been stranded for two days. Also they are unbelievably understaffed and weâ€™re cancelling a lot of flights. There was a mob of angry people. Save your money, they may be worse than southwest and spirit at this point.

After talking to an agent he got me a standby ticket for a 7am flight the next morning. After spending the night at airport, it looked like I would get a seat on the 7am flight. Even received a text from United saying ""Good news"" I had seat on that flight. Then after all the groups had boarded I approached agent desk and handed them my ticket and the agent announced they would be calling the standbys by name. So I sat back down, fully expecting my name to be called. She then pointed to a gentleman and he was allowed to board. She the pointed to another gentleman and asked him for his name. He answered an she said he could board. But he was with his wife. Agent said there was only one seat available and the agent let wife board and they were done boarding. I approached agent and showed her messaged from United that I had a seat on that flight. She said she had no idea what that message meant. I knew what it meant. It meant she had given my seat to someone else. instead of reading from the list of standbys like she said she would she handpicked her standbys. The only reason.

21342,United Airlines,3,"""customer experience is not important""",12th July 2023,True,"  I think, it would be a very beneficial eye opening experience for Scott Kirby to fly as a regular customer during bad weather conditions. Spend time in a long line for the travel assistance for rebooking the flight, and then trying to figure out where to spend a night or few nights before the next flight. I was coming from a wonderful European vacation on July 9th. As soon as I arrived to the Newark airport, I received a very unwelcome message that my connecting flight was canceled. The next 4 hours were extremely frustrating. The United App was not working. Long line to the travel assistance full of frustrated customers, elderly people, and parents with young crying children kept growing. A travel agent informed me that a seat for me is available no earlier than July 12th. I registered for the standby for the earliest flight the next day as well. I, as every other person in that line, needed to find a place to spend a night, possibly 3 nights. The agent was kind enough to give me 3 vouchers $15 each. I am a full time employee and have responsibilities. So, I had to inform my manager about my encounter. The next day I spent â€œcamping outâ€ at the Newark airport on a standby list. The overbooking practices help maximize the profits and brings hefty bonuses to the top management of the airline at the expense of their customers. In Europe airlines are penalized with high fines for overbooking. The airline should be able to develop a backup plans for bad weather, and not use it (bad weather) as an excuse for inconvenience, keeping travelers stranded for days, passing down the operating cost to customers. Seems like customer experience is not important for United airlines. ",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Phoenix,2023-07-01,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes,UA

Before finding out about my cancelled connected flight, my check in baggage was rechecked in. Since I was spending over 40 hours in the airport, I spoke to United Baggage Counter Service 3 TIMES! To know the whereabouts of my bag, and I wanted it with me during my wait in the Airport. The 1st time, I was told that even though my bag was rerouted, I could collect it and have it with me, then I could recheck it in before boarding my new flight to Toronto. I was told to do this by visiting baggage service the next day. The next day is here, it is my 2nd time. I was told it'll take 12 hours for me to retrieve it, ""look out for it at carousel 9"" I was told. And I could recheck it in. The 3rd and final time I spoke to Baggage Counter Service, this person behind the counter told me something completely different, he said that since my bag has been rerouted, I no longer have access to it until my final destination. And I was PROMISED that it will be with me on my new Toronto flight. 3 times, with 3 different answers. Saying that, luckily I saw my bag on carousel belt 9, attached with the reroute label and all. I picked it up to get my phone charger which I really needed. I asked one of the baggage workers if I could keep my bag with me and I will recheck it in myself. They said NO. It's in the system, and it's guaranteed to be with you. I finally landed in Toronto and not only did my bag not show up, but I found out that it's still in Newark Airport! I know this because United Baggage service in Toronto tracked it for me. Having been already frustrated waiting around for 40+ hours, now I have to deal with another problem.

My family and I purchased tickets for first class meaning we paid an extra $800 just for the airline to refuse our seats and sit us in economy because they â€œdonâ€™t have availabilityâ€. If they didnâ€™t have any available seats then why was I charged and the worst part of all of it was they gave a free upgrade to a couple to sit in first class the day of the flight! Itâ€™s free for them because I paid for it! The customer service phone line was a complete waste of time seeing as they did nothing for us. On our return flight home it took us almost two hours trying to get our bags checked because of the ticket situation even after calling the â€œhelpâ€ line.

21354,United Airlines,2,"""trip was an unmitigated disaster""",9th July 2023,True,"  I have flown United Airlines and its Star Alliance partners many times. However, this trip was an unmitigated disaster. Our departure to SFO was delayed by 3 hours because the flight crew was delayed getting in to DFW and needed their 8 hour rest. This meant we would miss our connection. As it turned out, the connecting flight was cancelled. The agent at check in would not rebook us on another airline nor put us on standby. Our bags were checked through to YVR. The agent in the United Club put us on standby for the next flight from SFO. Unfortunately, we could not get on this flight nor 2 other flights that we were on standby status. As a result, I ended up booking one way flights on another carrier to Seattle, stayed overnight and then took the bus to YVR so we could attend the first of 4 wedding events. The flight itself was fine; however, the baggage is another story. Our bags never made it to YVR. I spent countless hours texting with United Baggage over 5 days. We received conflicting messages about our bags being in YVR. We missed a pre-wedding soiree because we spent 4 1/2 hours at YVR airport looking for a bag that wasn't there and had to buy every day clothes plus clothes for the wedding. On Monday July 3, I received a phone call saying one bag as in YVR. I requested the bag to be delivered to our hotel. On the day of departure from YVR, the bag still hadn't arrived. I received a call while going through security that 2 bags would be sent to DFW and delivered to our home address. The bags were delivered to our home on Friday July 7. The garment bag that was supposed to be delivered to our hotel before departure on 7/6 is still in United's baggage system. 24-48 hr delay is excusable; however an entire 8 day vacation without baggage is totally inexcusable. This is the first time in all my years of travel I have encountered such poor baggage service. I'm inclined to not use United again, but then I would lose my Premier access status with its Star Alliance partners.

21364,United Airlines,1,"""no one knew where my bags were""",4th July 2023,True," Departure flight: Firstly, let me express I live in Atlanta, GA. We have one of the largest Airports in America, therefore, I understand the 2 hours plus rule. From the time I arrived in Newark, it was a terrible choice. My first leg on United Airlines was ATL to EWR, I arrived to Hartsfield Airport (ATL) to discover my flight would be 1 hour and 45 mins delayed. Not a big deal to most but I had a connecting flight to Denmark, Europe. As it got closer to the boarding time, an United assistant began to yell on the microphone, ""Y'all have to hurry and board or we will go illegal and you will have to wait longer"". If anyone came up to ask a question, ""Y'all have to hurry and board because we are about to go illegal"". She informed us, they would start boarding sooner due to them about to go ""illegal"". Finally, we are all boarded on the plane, we waited an extra 30 mins to taxi due to them allowing another United flight that was supposed to depart at 10ish pm to board our flight, they said we were not full so they could get more passengers on my flight. While this delay occurred because we have multiple people with the same seat. These genius people did not think about this. Secondly, I arrived at Newark, and it takes United 30 mins to get an associate to hook up a ramp for passenger departure of the aircraft. The pilot continues to apologize over the microphone several times. I literally had 5 mins to get to my connecting flight; it was pointless to even run during this time. I reached the United help desk to informed them I'd missed my connecting flight due to their delay, the woman assisted me by trying to get the next available flight but all of them made me miss my anniversary, which is the day I would have arrived to be with my spouse. At this point, they give me a hotel because I had an international flight. I asked several times if my bags would be on the new flight I'd been given, the United assistant reassured me they would. (It was not on my next flight after delayed for 10 hours.) The assistant gave me a meal voucher of $15 for breakfast and lunch. They provided a Lyft to the hotel, by this time, it was 12 am. The hotel was about a 20 min drive, and I felt like I'd passed a million hotels to arrive at such an unsatisfying one. You would have thought I was in a motel 6. After a 10-hour delay, I started my travel back to Newark (EWR), my international flight was on time, I was so happy to be away from this unprofessional airport. The staff was horrible going through security check out. I arrived to Aalborg, Europe to discover, no one knew where my bags were. I'd missed my anniversary and now I have absolutely No clothes. Returning flight: From Aalborg, Europe (AAL) to dreadful Newark (EWR), I arrived at Newark Airport (EWR) again but this time I had an 8-hour layover. I'd learned from my first experience to just take the extra time if you can. I put myself into the Newark International Airport Marriott, which is only 5 mins from the Airport. Trust me, I could tell the difference of this hotel as I arrived in the parking lot.

You have the choice to stay here in Birmingham or fly to Houston and we will provide a hotel room. Okay we chose to fly to Houston because who knows what could happen. We end up in a storm in Houston no fault to United Airlines but the issue is we lost a day in Honolulu and our room there was already paid for no refund issued. So we fly 7 1/2 hours straight to Honolulu on a crowded flight having to sit in the middle when our seats were originally by the window. So I didnâ€™t get the beautiful view of what I wanted to see. The food was terrible because we received a salad no dressing and I was thankful we ate dinner. The flight back wasnâ€™t even better. We got delayed in Los Angeles because the flight attendant was late in Honolulu. Then we go to customer service and they did accommodate us at another hotel with food vouchers. However the experience was horrible because most of the staff was rude and disingenuous on how to handle customers. Things could have been worse but paying for baggage, being re-seated on every flight was all too much and even with them putting us up in hotels. We still lost money and a day in Honolulu. I say this to say we stayed humble through the experience but it was still not enough to repay for our losses. Also on the flight home from Houston there was no wi-fi service so that sucked.

I had upgraded my seats to first class which I will now lose if I'm selected for standby more than likely not to mention its a poorer 737-800. I was going for a friends wedding. Not only have they now ruined this wedding they try and stick me on standby on a one stop flight, surely losing my first class seat without refunding my paid upgrade no doubt. I don't care what they say about weather or traffic control their airlines is trash. The way they treat their loyal customers is trash. Their fleet is old and trash. Their food is poor.

21375,United Airlines,1,"""do not fly United""",29th June 2023,True,"  We had book a 10 day vacation to Israel. We were first delayed in the Salt Lake Airport for 8 1/2 hours, missing our connection by several hours and being forced to stay in San Francisco for about 16 hours until the next flight from there left to Tel Aviv. Now, this by itself was very frustrating and meant we would miss a whole day of our vacation, no vacation and no work meant we were losing money by the hour, add onto that was the unhelpful attitude of the flight crew, the several different reasons given for delays (ranging from weather to flight crew deficiency, to plane malfunctions) and this was just a really bad day. We stay in San Francisco for an entire day and are back at the airport for the new flight. Now, the airline did provide us with a hotel (pretty bad one that smelled like smoke) and a few food vouchers, but we weren't very happy with them. The next flight gets delayed again and again until finally at about 2am (was supposed to leave at 8), they cancel the flight for another set of ambiguous reasons. at this point, there are 400+ angry people waiting in one line with about 2 agents and they are turning people away without so much as a hotel room. At this point we decided we would not be flying United, we've missed two days of vacation or work, we've been treated poorly and compensated only the bare minimum. We finally speak to an agent and demand monetary compensation as well as a refund for the cancelled flight (airlines are required to refund cancelled flights), and they refuse. They tell us there will be compensation but where, when, how is left ambiguous. We ended up flying Delta, completely smooth as wonderful process. Though we continually call, fill out forms, send emails, and the like, we have yet to see a dime of compensation for this truly terrible experiences. We stayed in touch with some other people on our flight and they continued to have problems with United (missed connections and the like) and were never compensated. The best that they were able to do was offer $300 vouchers for another flight. Are you kidding me? You think a silly $300 voucher could make up for the money we lost and the horrible experience we had? Not likely. As we are never planning to fly United again, a voucher is honestly just an insult at this point.

It has taken me over 3 days so far in the process of trying to retrieve my luggage. They canceled a flight so I could not get to my connecting flight. However they sent my luggage to the country where I was to get the connection to my final destination. Customer service gave me wrong information twice regarding my luggage. It takes hours to get in touch with customer service. In one attempt it was literally seven hours. When you finally do they give you the wrong information. This happened multiple times.

21377,United Airlines,1,"""lacking in empathy and extremely aggressive""",29th June 2023,True,"  I am one of the unlucky souls who booked a flight with United in late June 2023. I had to end my vacation in the Caribbean to return to Canada for a family emergency. What was supposed to be an 9h trip turned into a four day nightmare that cost me upwards of $2800 USD in out of pocket expenses, in addition to the original ticket price. I was shocked to find some United employees incredibly lacking in empathy and extremely aggressive. On day three of the ordeal, a customer service rep at Newark took a cursory look at my booking, claimed I was rebooked on an air Canada flight and was â€œno longer a United passenger.â€ I told her, the booking was not complete and Air Canada had explained (after I had gone back and forth between the two long queues) that United had not actually booked me, it was more of a temporary hold. The United staff refused to even speak to me, even as I begged tears streaming down my face explaining I had a family emergency. A manager then aggressively threatened to call security if I didnâ€™t step aside because I â€œhad already used up 30 minutes of their time,â€ which she knew was a blatant lie. I then had to go back to Air Canada and then called United on the phone, all of which was useless. I finally booked myself on a new ticket, via the United app, travelled to another terminal (C) and waited for 8 hours only to have that trip cancelled as well. I was now approaching day 4 so feeling utterly defeated, I booked myself a business class ticket home from Newark with Air Canada. It cost me $2300 USD and was a red eye with a long layover in Quebec City, but that flight DID make it and Iâ€™m now home. I think United deserves to be sued for its failure to support and look after the wellbeing of its customers. Shame on them and on lawmakers who allow this level of negligence and disregard for passengersâ€™ wellbeing (see reports of the atrocious conditions in some terminals especially Newark terminal C).

This two hour delay would have resulted in missing our connection and the international flight from LAX to MEL, but we found a flight out of CLT to LAX with absolutely no help from the AVL United employee (he gave us a phone number to call and sent us on our way, saying there was nothing he could do for us, even though he had just finished helping the couple in front of us with the same itinerary delays). Made it to LAX in time to catch the initial flight to MEL after booking the flight ourselves. Made it to our seats only to wind up sitting on the tarmac for two hours due to a flat tire caused by â€œrunning over a washerâ€ (read: negligence) on the runway. By the time the tire was fixed, the crew was over their authorized hours, and the flight was canceled. We were told that we would be rebooked to our initial destination (Melbourne), but we were rebooked to Sydney, which is about 539 miles off our initial destination. In order to solve this, we were directed to another United customer service desk where we stood in line for an hour with 50+ United customers dealing with similar â€œrebookingâ€ issues.

We were flying from Boston to Calgary, Canada via Newark with my two elderly parents (one of whom has a back problem and gastrointestinal issues) and my 5 month old baby, who was flying for the first time in his life. On the morning of our scheduled departure, United told us that the Boston-Newark leg of our journey was delayed because of an earlier delay impacting our planeâ€™s arrival, meaning we would not have sufficient time to make our Newark-Calgary connection. We spent over 2.5 hours on the phone with United trying to find an alternative flight, but were informed that the earliest available alternative was not for another two days on April 18th, 2023, even though we showed great flexibility e.g. we were willing to connect via a different city, split our family up so we flew on different airplanes, and / or accept a longer connection time. Despite this, United said there was absolutely no option for us to fly for another 2 days. They also confirmed that the reason for the earlier delay was boarding of the aircraft taking longer than expected, which was within their control. We looked ourselves into flying with another airline, but the cost of such last-minute tickets was thousands of dollars per passenger and therefore prohibitively expensive. This meant cancelling our United flights and getting a refund was not a feasible solution. United did NOT offer us the option of arranging a flight with a different airline carrier without additional expense, which is contrary to our rights under Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We therefore accepted the new United itinerary on April 18th. We were appalled that United was not able to re-schedule us for two full days.  Our destination city of Calgary is not a small town - it has a population of 1.45 million people and a very active international airport. We were stuck in Boston during the very busy Boston Marathon weekend, which forced us to stay at an expensive hotel 2 more nights than we planned as we could not find last minute accommodation elsewhere. We incurred additional meal costs and transportation costs to the airport. Our total additional expenses during our delay period WAS USD 1,110. We filed a detailed complaint with United Customer Care. It took them close to 2 months to reply to us, and when they did they vaguely blamed the weather (first time we heard of this excuse!) and refused to compensate us at all.
